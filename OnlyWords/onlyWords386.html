Malpractice
For
injuries
caused
by
the
negligence
of
medical
professional
or
lawyer
the
government
generally
does
not
punish
the
wrongdoer
but
gives
the
victim
the
right
to
pursue
private
civil
lawsuit
called
tort
action
against
the
wrongdoer.
This
chapter
outlines
the
actions
that
lead
to
most
professional
malpractice
lawsuits.
General
accidents
and
injuries
and
injuries
occurring
to
workers
on
the
job
are
discussed
in
the
Personal

Law
General
Chapter.

Professional
Malpractice
malpractice
lawsuit
can
be
brought
against
any
kind
of
professional
including
psychologists
clergy
accountants
financial
advisors
doctors
and
lawyers.
Two
common
types
of
professional
malpractice
claims
are
those
against
doctors
and
lawyers.
Legal
Malpractice
There
is
no
precise
definition
of
legal
malpractice.
Generally
speaking
lawyer
commits
legal
malpractice
when
he
or
she
fails
to
provide
quality
legal
services
to
client.
Bad
conduct
that
is
not
unique
to
lawyers
may
lead
to
lawsuit
but
it
does
not
constitute
legal
malpractice.
For
instance
lawyer
who
misses
deadlines
inadequately
prepares
for
trial
or
represents
both
sides
in
dispute
without
informing
both
parties
commits
legal
malpractice.
lawyer
who
steals
funds
from
assaults
or
defrauds
client
has
committed
crime
but
probably
has
not
committed
legal
malpractice.

legal
malpractice
lawsuit
generally
has
four
elements
duty
breach
injury
and
proximate
causation.
judge
or
jury
examines
all
four
elements
in
legal
malpractice
trial
and
if
any
element
is
missing
the
plaintiff
cannot
recover.
Duty
The
duty
lawyer
owes
his
or
her
client
has
two
components.
The
lawyer
must
exercise
the
legal
skill
that
competent
attorney
would
exercise
and
must
meet
all
of
his
or
her
fiduciary
obligations
to
the
client.
Fiduciary
obligations
include
duty
of
undivided
loyalty
to
the
client
interests
and
confidentiality.
No
lawyer
is
expected
to
know
the
law
so
well
that
he
or
she
can
give
perfect
answers
to
obscure
legal
questions.
Lawyers
are
expected
to
know
how
to
research
issues
and
to
recognize
their
limits
when
they
reach
an
unsettled
or
unclear
area
of
law.
Breach
lawyer
commits
breach
if
he
or
she
fails
to
do
his
or
her
duty.
Breach
is
frequently
the
toughest
element
to
prove
in
legal
malpractice
lawsuit
because
lawyer
can
make
mistakes
and
still
not
commit
breach.
Law
is
an
inexact
science.
Even
competent
lawyers
frequently
disagree
on
the
best
course
of
action
in
particular
legal
matter.
Sometimes
the
strategy
chosen
is
combination
of
knowledge
about
the
law
and
how
the
lawyer
thinks
judge
or
jury
will
react
to
the
facts
of
case.
client
may
be
able
to
show
that
another
lawyer
would
have
pursued
different
strategy
and
still
the
client
may
be
unable
to
show
that
the
first
lawyer
committed
breach.
Injury
plaintiff
must
show
that
he
or
she
was
injured
by
the
lawyer
breach
of
duty.
For
example
lawyer
might
miss
deadline
but
if
he
or
she
is
subsequently
granted
an
extension
the
client
is
not
injured.
If
missing
the
deadline
bars
the
plaintiff
claim
however
he
or
she
has
been
injured.
lawyer
might
forget
to
assert
claim
but
if
the
claim
would
have
been
denied
anyway
the
client
has
not
been
injured.
Usually
plaintiff
only
recovers
direct
economic
losses
such
as
the
money
needed
to
pay
another
attorney
to
re-do
legal
work
any
fees
or
penalties
paid
or
any
interest
income
lost
because
of
an
attorney
malpractice.
It
is
difficult
although
not
impossible
to
recover
for
speculative
losses
that
is
for
what
might
have
happened
if
different
lawyer
had
been
hired
emotional
losses
or
legal
expenses
incurred
hiring
new
lawyer
to
sue
the
previous
lawyer.
Proximate
Cause
Finally
the
client
must
show
that
the
breach
was
the
proximate
cause
of
the
plaintiff
injury.
Proximate
cause
is
thorny
legal
concept
that
essentially
asks
whether
the
breach
was
sufficiently
responsible
for
the
injury
so
that
the
lawyer
should
be
held
responsible.
Proximate
cause
is
easiest
to
prove
if
lawyer
misses
deadline
or
gives
advice
that
is
clearly
wrong.
In
these
cases
the
client
usually
can
show
exactly
what
would
have
happened
had
the
lawyer
met
the
deadline
or
given
correct
advice.
Proximate
cause
is
more
difficult
to
show
in
cases
in
which
lawyer
pursues
course
of
action
in
trial
that
works
to
the
client
disadvantage.
In
this
case
the
client
has
to
show
what
the
judge
or
jury
would
have
done
had
the
lawyer
chosen
another
strategy.
This
can
be
difficult
to
show.
The
client
needs
to
prove
to
the
judge
or
jury
satisfaction
what
another
lawyer
would
have
done
and
how
the
jury
in
the
underlying
case
would
have
reacted
to
that
strategy.
The
first
lawyer
might
argue
successfully
that
even
if
different
strategy
had
been
pursued
the
outcome
of
the
case
would
have
been
the
same.
Attorneys
who
try
legal
malpractice
cases
have
had
increasing
success
recently
with
new
theories
of
liability
for
legal
malpractice.
One
trend
focuses
on
attorney
investments
and
financial
dealings.
Courts
have
found
that
lawyer
breached
fiduciary
duty
to
client
by
failing
to
reveal
stock
ownership
in
an
opposing
corporate
party
or
by
using
insider
information
learned
about
the
client
to
make
profits
in
the
stock
market.
Another
growing
trend
is
for
the
court
to
allow
claims
brought
against
lawyers
by
persons
other
than
clients.
For
example
the
beneficiaries
under
client
will
might
bring
legal
malpractice
action
against
lawyer
who
incorrectly
drafted
deceased
client
will
if
the
beneficiaries
are
dissatisfied
with
their
share
of
the
estate.
Depositors
in
failed
savings
and
loan
company
might
sue
lawyers
who
gave
advice
to
the
savings
and
loan.
Medical
Malpractice
Medical
malpractice
includes
many
forms
of
liability-producing
conduct
that
occur
in
rendering
medical
services.
Medical
malpractice
does
not
apply
solely
to
medical
doctors.
Psychiatrists
dentists
nurses
and
hospitals
can
be
sued
for
medical
malpractice.
Wrongful
conduct
that
is
not
unique
to
doctors
or
other
health
care
professionals
may
give
rise
to
legal
action
but
does
not
meet
the
definition
of
medical
malpractice.
For
example
patient
might
bring
breach
of
contract
claim
against
doctor
who
fails
to
provide
services
agreed
upon
in
contract
or
patient
might
bring
fraud
charges
against
doctor
for
misrepresenting
his
or
her
expertise.
These
are
not
medical
malpractice
claims.
Elements
of
Medical
Malpractice
medical
malpractice
lawsuit
--
like
legal
malpractice
action
--
generally
has
four
elements
duty
breach
injury
and
proximate
causation.
judge
or
jury
examines
all
four
elements
in
medical
malpractice
trial
and
if
any
element
is
missing
the
plaintiff
cannot
recover.
Duty
doctor
who
has
agreed
to
treat
patient
has
duty
to
that
patient
to
use
at
least
the
same
level
of
care
that
any
other
reasonably
competent
doctor
would
use
to
treat
condition
under
the
same
circumstances.
One
problem
in
determining
duty
is
that
the
average
juror
or
judge
may
not
be
able
to
determine
what
doctor
should
have
done
in
particular
instance.
Medical
malpractice
lawsuits
require
expert
testimony
from
another
doctor
as
to
the
standard
of
care
that
should
have
been
given.
The
plaintiff
needs
an
affidavit
from
medical
expert
when
starting
lawsuit.
There
are
many
complex
questions
in
deciding
what
testimony
to
allow.
In
every
case
the
judge
must
decide
whether
doctor
actions
are
to
be
judged
against
all
other
doctors
or
only
against
doctors
specializing
in
particular
type
of
practice.
Some
judges
may
allow
evidence
of
what
other
doctors
in
the
same
region
would
do
while
some
judges
allow
testimony
about
what
doctors
in
other
parts
of
the
country
would
have
done.
Success
in
medical
malpractice
case
frequently
depends
on
how
judge
answers
these
questions.
Breach
person
breaches
duty
when
he
or
she
fails
to
use
the
same
level
of
care
another
reasonably
competent
professional
would
exercise
in
the
same
circumstances.
Breach
is
frequently
the
toughest
point
to
prove
in
medical
malpractice
lawsuit
because
competent
doctors
frequently
disagree
on
the
best
course
of
action
in
particular
medical
matter.
Like
law
medicine
is
an
inexact
science.
client
may
show
that
another
doctor
would
have
taken
different
course
of
action
and
still
be
unable
to
show
the
first
doctor
committed
breach.
The
plaintiff
must
prove
the
level
of
care
reasonably
competent
professional
would
have
exercised
and
show
that
the
defendant
actions
fell
short
of
that
level.
Injury
Injury
is
usually
not
difficult
to
prove
in
medical
malpractice
actions.
patient
who
dies
or
suffers
permanent
disability
or
chronic
pain
obviously
has
been
injured.
Often
it
is
the
doctor
who
has
most
trouble
disproving
this
element
because
it
can
be
difficult
to
prove
that
patient
who
claims
to
be
injured
is
not.
Many
legitimate
injuries
such
as
whiplash
have
few
quantifiable
manifestations
even
though
they
cause
their
sufferers
to
feel
pain.
An
injury
need
not
be
permanent
to
be
compensable.
Proximate
Cause
Finally
proximate
causation
can
be
difficult
for
patient
to
prove
because
bad
result
does
not
necessarily
equal
malpractice.
Even
with
excellent
treatment
patient
might
not
recover
totally
from
the
condition
for
which
he
or
she
seeks
treatment.
doctor
accused
of
malpractice
might
be
able
to
show
that
even
had
different
treatment
been
followed
the
patient
would
have
suffered
identical
injuries.
Third-Party
Lawsuits
Third
persons
can
sometimes
bring
medical
malpractice
lawsuits
against
doctors.
For
example
person
who
gets
an
infectious
disease
from
friend
might
sue
the
friend
doctor
for
inadequately
treating
the
disease.
person
injured
in
an
automobile
accident
might
bring
medical
malpractice
lawsuit
against
the
driver
doctor
if
the
doctor
medicated
the
patient
without
telling
the
patient
not
to
operate
vehicle
while
under
the
effect
of
the
medication.
Consent
Forms
Consent
forms
required
by
most
doctors
and
hospitals
typically
include
warnings
that
patients
must
assume
all
the
risks
of
any
surgical
procedures.
By
signing
one
of
these
forms
patient
does
not
give
up
all
rights
to
sue
if
things
go
wrong.
Such
an
agreement
may
not
be
valid
if
doctor
does
not
fully
inform
the
patient
of
risks
associated
with
particular
procedure.
Even
valid
consent
form
is
no
protection
for
doctor
who
either
performs
surgery
that
goes
beyond
the
consent
given
or
who
fails
to
perform
procedure
according
to
well-accepted
medical
standards.
