Although
no
one
likes
to
think
about
dying
there
are
good
reasons
to
prepare
for
this
inevitable
event
by
setting
up
plan
to
distribute
one
estate
after
death.

of
all
his

and
possessions
and
includes
bank
accounts
real

furniture
automobiles
stocks
bonds
life
insurance
policies
retirement

pensions
and
death

If
person
plans
well
his
or
her

can
often
be
passed
on
after
death
quickly
easily
and
subject
to
fewer

This
chapter
discusses
the
most
common
estate
planning
tools
--
wills
and
trusts.
Living
wills
guardianship
and
conservatorship
are
discussed
in
the
Elder
Law
Chapter.
Wills
will
is
the
most
common
document
used
to
specify
how
an
estate
should
be
handled
after
death.
Anyone
designated
to
receive
property
under
will
or
trust
is
called
beneficiary.
will
can
be
simple
or
elaborate
depending
upon
the
size
of
the
estate
and
the
wishes
of
the
person
who
makes
it
called
the
testator.
Many
types
of
post-death
instructions
can
be
described
in
will.

who

will
can
disinherit

if
the
testator
does
not
want
the
child
to
receive
any
part
of
the
estate.
The
options
for
what
person
can
do
with
will
are
varied
but
limited.
Requirements
for
Valid
Will
Each
state
sets
slightly
different
formal
requirements
for
the
creation
of
legal
will.
In
Illinois
person
must
be
at
least
years
old
and
must
be
of
sound
mind
and
memory
in
order
to
make
legal
will.
Sound
mind
and
memory
means
that
the
person
has
no
disability
that
prevents
the
person
from
understanding
the
full
nature
of
the
will
document.
In
Illinois
will
must
be
in
writing
and
must
be
signed
by
the
testator.
The
will
must
also
be
witnessed
in
the
special
manner
provided
by
law
by
at
least
two
other
people.
handwritten
will
often
called
holographic
will
is
valid
in
Illinois
provided
that
it
is
witnessed
and
signed
by
two
people.
Individuals
must
sign
their
own
wills
but
if
they
are
illiterate
or
otherwise
incapacitated
they
can
direct
another
person
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
to
sign
for
them.
will
is
valid
until
it
is
revoked
or
superseded
by
new
will.
An
individual
provision
can
be
changed
by
codicil
which
is
described
in
the
section
Changing
and
Updating
Wills.
It
is
not
necessary
to
hire
an
attorney
to
create
will.
non-attorney
can
create
will
but
he
or
she
must
pay
close
attention
to
the
details
outlined
above.
Smaller
estates
can
be
described
simply
and
making
will
to
disperse
smaller
estate
can
be
done
by
almost
anyone.
The
simplest
will
in
history
ever
to
be
declared
valid
by
court
contained
only
three
words
All
to
wife.
However
lawyer
guidance
is
very
helpful
if
the
testator
has
complicated
property
holdings
or
an
estate
with
many
assets
especially
if
they
are
located
in
several
different
places.
In
these
cases
an
attorney
help
can
ensure
that
the
transfer
of
property
described
in
the
will
is
done
in
way
that
minimizes
the
survivor
tax
liability.
Also
complicated
estate
may
require
documents
in
addition
to
the
will
such
as
trust
agreements
to
ensure
that
all
of
the
person
wishes
are
carried
out.
Personal
Representative
will
typically
appoints
someone
called
personal
representative
to
carry
out
the
specific
wishes
of
the
person
who
has
died
--
the
decedent.
The
personal
representative
should
be
trusted
friend
or
family
member
who
should
be
made
fully
aware
of
his
or
her
duties
before
the
decedent
dies.
Under
state
law
personal
representative
appointed
by
testator
must
be
resident
of
the
United
States
but
need
not
be
resident
of
Illinois.
personal
representative
must
do
many
things
including
collecting
and
managing
the
decedent
assets
collecting
any
money
owed
at
the
time
of
death
selling
assets
if
necessary
to
pay
estate
taxes
or
expenses
and
filing
all
required
tax
returns.
Because
personal
representative
is
allowed
to
charge
fee
for
doing
this
work
choosing
friend
or
family
member
who
is
also
beneficiary
to
fill
this
role
may
be
good
choice
as
he
or
she
may
not
charge
the
full
amount
allowed
by
law.
It
is
wise
for
testator
to
name
one
or
more
contingent
personal
representatives
who
can
take
over
the
responsibilities
of
the
primary
personal
representative
if
the
primary
personal
representative
is
unable
to
assume
the
responsibilities
of
the
position.
If
person
does
not
name
personal
representative
in
his
or
her
will
state
law
establishes
the
order
in
which
probate
court
appoints
relatives
to
act
as
personal
representative.
If
none
of
these
family
members
agree
to
be
the
personal
representative
the
circuit
court
may
appoint
professional
administrator
to
do
the
job.
Appointing
Guardian
for
Children
person
with
minor
or
dependent
children
can
name
in
will
guardian
to
care
for
those
children
should
there
be
no
surviving
parent.
If
person
fails
to
name
someone
to
assume
the
role
of
guardian
the
probate
court
appoints
someone.
The
person
chosen
by
the
court
will
usually
be
close
relative
or
friend
but
it
may
not
be
the
person
the
parent
would
have
chosen.
As
with
the
selection
of
personal
representative
it
is
important
that
the
potential
guardian
understand
the
provisions
of
the
will
and
is
willing
to
accept
the
responsibilities
of
being
guardian.
Also
the
testator
should
name
an
alternate
guardian
in
case
the
primary
guardian
is
unable
to
accept
the
responsibility.
Of
course
the
selection
of
guardian
for
children
is
likely
to
influence
how
the
parent
wants
to
distribute
his
or
her
property.
Otherwise
decedent
money
might
go
to
one
person
while
his
or
her
children
go
to
another
person.
The
parent
may
want
to
give
property
to
someone
only
if
the
recipient
accepts
guardianship
of
child.
In
this
way
the
guardian
is
given
the
financial
resources
to
care
for
the
child.
Planning
for
Incapacity
People
drafting
wills
often
use
the
opportunity
to
plan
for
the
possibility
of
their
own
incapacity.
By
preparing
document
called
power
of
attorney
they
can
give
another
person
of
their
choosing
full
legal
authority
to
act
on
their
behalf
should
they
become
unable
to
handle
their
personal
and
financial
affairs.
Without
power
of
attorney
person
family
might
need
to
go
to
court
to
have
someone
appointed
to
handle
the
person
legal
affairs.
If
power
of
attorney
is
made
part
of
the
will
it
is
essential
that
the
will
be
made
known
to
family
members
before
the
testator
becomes
incapacitated.
If
will
is
kept
secret
locked
away
in
safe
deposit
box
until
person
dies
it
will
be
too
late
for
the
power
of
attorney
provisions
to
be
useful.
Some
people
also
use
document
called
power
of
attorney
for
health
care
to
make
health
care
decisions
in
advance
in
case
they
subsequently
become
incapacitated.
Creating
power
of
attorney
for
health
care
is
discussed
in
the
Elder
Law
Chapter.
Restrictions
on
Wills
In
order
to
protect
spouses
and
dependent
children
Illinois
law
prevents
person
from
entirely
disinheriting
spouse
or
child
without
the
consent
of
the
one
who
is
disinherited.
Under
Illinois
law
spouse
is
entitled
to
at
least
plus
for
each
dependant
child.
This
amount
is
intended
to
support
the
decedent
family
for
the
first
nine
months
following
the
death
of
the
decedent.
spouse
receives
this
amount
of
money
whether
or
not
there
is
will.
This
spousal
award
is
considered
preferred
claim
and
debt
of
the
estate.
The
provisions
of
this
law
may
be
overcome
in
two
ways.
First
will
may
specifically
state
that
its
provisions
are
meant
to
stand
in
the
place
of
the
spousal
award
and
the
spouse
does
not
renounce
the
will.
In
this
case
the
terms
of
the
will
would
govern
distribution.
Second
the
spouse
may
renounce
the
will
and
take
an
elective
share
of
the
estate.
In
this
case
distribution
of
the
estate
would
be
governed
by
statute.
Note
however
that
renunciation
would
not
be
available
to
spouse
who
had
signed
an
agreement
during
the
life
of
the
decedent
in
which
the
spouse
agreed
to
abide
by
the
terms
of
the
will.
Occasionally
this
happens
through
prenuptial
agreement
for
example
in
which
second
spouse
agrees
that
an
entire
estate
will
go
to
children
from
first
marriage.
person
may
legally
disinherit
an
independent
child
by
clearly
specifying
in
will
that
the
child
not
receive
any
of
the
estate.
There
are
other
restrictions
on
wills.
Anything
owned
in
joint
tenancy
with
another
person
will
go
to
the
surviving
joint
tenant.
Arrangements
must
be
made
to
end
the
joint
tenancy
before
death
if
one
joint
tenant
does
not
want
the
other
to
inherit
the
jointly
held
property.
Because
there
may
be
significant
tax
consequences
in
doing
so
these
changes
should
be
made
only
after
consulting
an
attorney.
Other
possessions
not
considered
part
of
an
estate
are
those
already
promised
to
someone
else.
For
example
testator
cannot
specify
in
will
that
someone
other
than
the
beneficiary
of
life
insurance
policy
gets
the
benefits
described
in
that
policy.
However
person
can
designate
his
or
her
estate
as
the
beneficiary
of
life
insurance
policy.
In
this
case
the
money
from
the
policy
will
be
added
to
other
estate
assets
and
will
be
distributed
according
to
the
will.
Similarly
the
money
from
retirement
plan
goes
to
the
persons
named
on
the
plan
regardless
of
whether
they
are
beneficiaries
in
will.
Laws
designed
to
uphold
public
policy
also
limit
what
can
be
done
with
person
assets
after
death.
For
example
conditions
in
will
encouraging
someone
to
do
something
illegal
or
immoral
in
order
to
inherit
money
or
property
would
not
be
enforced.
Changing
and
Updating
Wills
The
provisions
of
will
are
valid
until
they
are
changed
revoked
destroyed
or
invalidated
by
the
writing
of
new
will.
Changes
or
additions
to
will
can
be
included
in
document
called
codicil.
Codicils
must
be
written
signed
and
witnessed
in
the
same
way
as
will.
Wills
cannot
be
changed
simply
by
crossing
out
existing
language
or
writing
in
new
provisions.
In
order
to
avoid
making
new
will
or
codicil
each
time
person

will
can
specify
that
personal
property
is
to
be

person
can
then
revise
the
separate
document
as
often
as
necessary
without
observing
all
of
the
formalities
required
to
change
the
will
itself.
If
someone
dies
with
will
that
is
not
up-to-date
people
may
not
be
provided
for
adequately.
For
example
person
chosen
to
be
personal
representative
or
guardian
may
have
died
or
fallen
out
of
favor
with
the
author
of
the
will
or
favorite
charity
may
no
longer
be
in
existence.
significant
amount
of
case
law
has
dealt
with
how
probate
court
is
to
proceed
with
will
that
has
become
unenforceable
because
of
changed
circumstances.
These
headaches
can
be
avoided
if
will
is
reviewed
at
least
every
two
years
and
revised
for
major
changes
in
tax
laws
or
for
personal
events
such
as
births
deaths
marriages
divorces
or
significant
changes
in
the
size
of
the
estate.
It
is
also
good
idea
to
review
will
if
its
author
moves
to
another
state
because
the
new
state
of
residency
may
have
different
inheritance
and
tax
laws.
The
Right
of

As
discussed
previously
Illinois
probate
code
protects
surviving
spouses
from
being
entirely
disinherited
by
decedent

is
unsatisfied
with

or
her
portion
under

will
is
allowed
to
exercise
the
right

and
take
statutory
share
of
the
estate.
If
the
decedent
left
no
descendants
the
spouse
statutory
share
is
half
of
the
decedent
estate.
If
the
decedent
left
descendants
the
spouse
statutory
share
is
one-third
of
the
decedent
estate.
Thus
the
one-third
portion
is
the
minimum
amount
surviving
spouse
may
receive.
will
can
give
more
to
the
surviving
spouse
but
if
it
gives
less
the
surviving
spouse
can
simply
elect
to
forego
his
or
her
share
under
the
will
in
favor
of
this
statutorily
guaranteed
one-half
or
one-third
share.
Note
however
that
the
statutory
share
is
not
available
to
spouse
who
has
entered
contract
during
the
life
of
the
descendent
to
accept
the
provisions
of
the
will.
Dying
Without
Will
If
person
does
not
have
will
or
has
not
adequately
planned
for
the
distribution
of
the
person
estate
at
death
survivors
can
face
complicated
time-consuming
and
costly
process.
Often
survivors
wind
up
having
to
pay
more
taxes
on
their
inheritance
than
they
would
have
paid
had
there
been
will
or
other
estate
planning
tool.
To
provide
for
surviving
friends
and
relatives
or
to
support
favorite
causes
or
charities
person
can
plan
for
the
distribution
of
his
or
her
estate
after
death.
With
planning
an
estate
can
be
distributed
as
fairly
as
possible
with
as
little
tax
burden
as
legally
allowed.
When
decedent
leaves
no
will
or
fails
to
dispose
of
all
property
through
will
the
decedent
is
said
to
have
died
intestate.
When
person
dies
intestate
the
circuit
court
steps
in
to
divide
the
decedent
estate
among
the
decedent
surviving
relatives
decedents
according
to
formula
set
out
in
the
state
inheritance
laws.

any

order

After
all
the
claims
against
the
estate
are
paid
and
if
the
decedent
has
surviving
spouse
and
no
children
the
entire
estate
goes
to
the
spouse.
If
there
are
children
and
no
surviving
spouse
the
entire
estate
is
divided
equally
among
the
children.
If
there
is
both
surviving
spouse
and
children
half
of
the
estate
goes
to
the
spouse
and
the
remaining
half
is
divided
equally
among
the
children.
If
the
decedent
leaves
neither
spouse
nor
children
the
estate
goes
to
the
decedent
parents
brothers
sisters
nieces
and
nephews.
If
the
decedent
leaves
none
of
these
relatives
the
estate
goes
to
the
decedents
grandparents
aunts
uncles
and
cousins.
If
none
of
these
relatives
exist
investigation
continues
down
the
line
of
inheritance
in
an
attempt
to
locate
the
decedent
nearest
kin.
Illinois
law
does
not
distinguish
between
kin
of
whole
or
half-blood.
If
however
the
decedent
leaves
no
kin
the
estate
goes
to
the
county
where
the
decedent
lived
or
in
which
the
estate
property
is
located.
One
problem
with
relying
on
circuit
court
applying
state
inheritance
laws
to
distribute
one
estate
is
that
it
may
not
distribute
the
estate
in
the
manner
the
decedent
would
have
wanted.
State
inheritance
laws
only
recognize
relatives.
The
inheritance
laws
never
permit
the
circuit
court
to
support
decedent
close
friend
lover
or
favorite
charities.
Clearly
for
most
people
writing
will
or
creating
trust
is
advisable.

another
frequently
used

that

Unlike
will
which
in
some
cases
can
be
drafted
without
the
help
of
an
attorney
person
should
never
draft
trust
without
the
aid
of
lawyer.
Many
complex
laws
regulate
trusts
and
trusts
must
be
carefully
structured
if
they
are
to
take
advantage
of
beneficial
tax
treatment.
An
experienced
attorney
should
always
assist
person
in
drafting
trust
so
that
it
is
valid
meets
the
needs
of
the
estate
and
does
not
conflict
with
any
previously
drafted
will.
Advantages
and
Disadvantages
of
Trusts
Trusts
have
many
advantages
over
wills.
All
trusts
have
the
advantage
of
allowing
the
grantor
to
determine
who
receives
the
benefit
of
the
money
when
they
receive
it
and
what
conditions
must
be
met.
If
spouse
is
unable
or
unwilling
to
manage
assets
if
children
are
minors
or
unable
to
handle
money
responsibly
or
if
beneficiary
is
disabled
creating
trust
can
be
better
way
of
passing
on
assets.
Both
living
and
testamentary
trusts
are
popular
ways
of
providing
for
beneficiaries
future
educational
or
medical
costs.
Some
advantages
are
particular
to
living
trusts.
First
living
trust
can
give
its
grantor
substantial
tax
advantages.
Second
possessions
held
in
living
trust
are
not
subject
to
estate
administration
by
the
circuit
court
after
the
grantor
dies.
Survivors
do
not
have
to
reveal
the
details
of
any
possessions
held
in
trust
through
the
public
filing
process
that
takes
place
during
probate.
In
addition
if
the
grantor
owns
real
estate
in
another
state
establishing
living
trust
for
the
title
to
that
property
may
allow
survivors
to
avoid
probate
in
the
other
state.
living
trust
can
free
the
grantor
from
the
burden
of
overseeing
his
or
her
financial
affairs
because
trustee
manages
all
the
assets
of
living
trust.
More
importantly
living
trust
allows
trustee
to
manage
the
trust
funds
in
the
event
that
its
creator
becomes
incapacitated
or
mentally
or
physically
unable
to
oversee
his
or
her
possessions.
If
living
trust
contains
all
of
person
assets
then
he
or
she
may
not
need
will
and
his
or
her
survivors
may
be
able
to
avoid
probate.
If
only
part
of
person
possessions
are
held
in
living
trust
then
will
is
necessary
to
distribute
those
items
in
the
estate
not
placed
into
trust.
However
pour-over
provision
in
will
can
place
any
possessions
remaining
upon
death
into
pre-existing
living
trust.
The
primary
disadvantage
of
living
trust
is
that
it
involves
the
loss
of
some
flexibility
and
control
over
one
assets.
Unlike
wills
which
become
effective
only
at
death
living
trust
becomes
effective
immediately
upon
its
creation.
For
the
person
who
wants
to
retain
unrestricted
control
over
his
or
her
estate
will
or
testamentary
trust
is
better
estate
planning
tool
because
it
can
be
changed
at
any
time
prior
to
death.
The
primary
advantage
of
testamentary
trust
is
that
it
allows
the
grantor
to
retain
unrestricted
control
over
his
or
her
estate.
testamentary
trust
becomes
effective
only
upon
the
death
of
its
grantor.
Like
will
testamentary
trust
can
be
changed
at
any
time
prior
to
death.
The
primary
disadvantage
to
testamentary
trusts
is
that
they
do
not
take
advantage
of
the
beneficial
tax
treatment
given
to
living
trusts.
Because
testamentary
trust
only
takes
effect
when
the
grantor
dies
the
grantor
cannot
enjoy
any
tax
advantage
during
his
or
her
life.
Also
most
testamentary
trusts
must
go
through
probate.
Revocable
and
Irrevocable
Trusts
living
trust
can
be
either
revocable
or
irrevocable.
As
implied
by
their
names
revocable
trust
can
be
changed
or
revoked
after
its
creation
while
an
irrevocable
trust
cannot
be
changed
or
revoked.
revocable
trust
is
quite
often
devised
to
supplement
will
and/or
to
name
someone
to
handle
the
grantor
affairs
should
the
grantor
become
incapacitated.
trust
usually
must
be
made
irrevocable
if
the
grantor
wants
to
avoid
income
or
estate
taxes.
Tax
authorities
consider
the
grantor
of
revocable
trust
to
be
the
owner
of
the
property
because
he
or
she
still
controls
the
property.
For
this
reason
income
from
assets
held
in
revocable
trust
must
be
reported
as
income
to
the
grantor
for
income
tax
purposes.
At
the
death
of
the
grantor
property
in
revocable
trust
is
included
in
the
estate
for
calculating
estate
taxes.
An
irrevocable
trust
is
often
designed
to
be
the
beneficiary
of
life
insurance
policy.
Such
life
insurance
trust
can
also
spell
out
how
the
policy
money
is
distributed
to
survivors.
In
addition
irrevocable
trusts
are
often
set
up
to
manage
money
given
to
minors
and
to
charities.
Finally
an
irrevocable
trust
can
be
used
to
transfer
assets
to
another
person
in
the
event
that
the
grantor
requires
expensive
medical
care.
Although
doing
so
may
protect
the
grantor
family
by
ensuring
that
the
cost
of
medical
care
does
not
wipe
out
the
family
fortune
it
may
also
make
the
grantor
ineligible
to
receive
federal
and
state
Medical
Assistance.
Probate
With
few
exceptions
the
estate
of
person
who
dies
owning
property
in
his
or
her
name
cannot
be
legally
distributed
without
first
going
through
probate.
Only
if
all
of
decedent
property
is
held
in
joint
tenancy
or
in
trust
can
survivors
avoid
probate.
Probate
can
operate
with
court
supervision
called
supervised
administration
or
without
court
supervision
called
independent
administration.
Some
simple
small
estates
may
be
administered
through
summary
administration.
Regardless
of
the
type
of
administration
the
first
duty
of
the
circuit
court
is
to
determine
whether
the
decedent
left
valid
will.
The
person
in
possession
of
decedent
will
must
file
it
with
the
clerk
of
the
circuit
court
within
days
of
the
decedent
death.
If
the
decedent
left
valid
will
the
court
oversees
the
process
of
settling
the
estate
according
to
the
terms
of
the
will.
If
the
decedent
did
not
leave
will
or
if
the
circuit
court
determines
the
will
is
invalid
the
court
applies
the
state
inheritance
laws
described
earlier
to
the
estate.
Summary
administration
is
available
if
the
estate
is
or
less
all
claims
against
the
estate
are
known
there
are
no
taxes
due
and
all
the
heirs
and
legatees
consent
to
the
process.
In
summary
administration
the
circuit
court
determines
the
rights
of
the
claimants
directs
payments
and
distributes
the
estate
at
single
hearing.
Independent
administration
permits
the
personal
representative
to
administer
the
estate
without
court
orders
or
filings.
Unless
disputes
arise
between
the
beneficiaries
or
with
third
parties
or
unless
requested
to
intervene
by
the
personal
representative
or
an
interested
party
the
court
is
involved
only
to
open
and
close
the
estate.
Independent
administration
increases
family
privacy
because
no
inventory
or
accounting
is
usually
filed.
The
process
also
reduces
the
time
involved
in
probate.
If
an
interested
person
objects
to
independent
administration
the
court
must
supervise
the
administration.
Supervised
administration
requires
the
personal
representative
to
file
specific
documents
with
the
court
such
as
an
estate
inventory
and
periodic
accountings.
The
personal
representative
must
also
obtain
court
approval
to
perform
such
duties
as
selling
or
leasing
estate
property.
Avoiding
Death
Taxes
carefully
created
estate
plan
can
considerably
reduce
the
tax
burden
on
an
estate.
Illinois
has
no
estate
tax
provisions.
Other
than
income
taxes
only
the
federal
estate
tax
applies
to
decedents
who
were
Illinois
residents
or
whose
property
was
located
in
Illinois.
Under
federal
tax
law
person
is
allowed
to
leave
tax-free
to
one
or
more
individuals
other
than
surviving
spouse.
The
surviving
spouse
is
entitled
to
receive
an
unlimited
amount
tax-free.
If
the
estate
is
very
large
one
however
and
the
entire
estate
is
left
to
the
surviving
spouse
that
surviving
spouse
may
lose
the
option
of
giving
tax-free
to
individuals
of
his
or
her
own
choosing.
The
federal
government
inheritance
tax
scheme
is
quite
complicated
however
an
experienced
tax
attorney
can
help
an
individual
avoid
paying
unnecessary
estate
taxes.
Regardless
of
whether
the
recipient
pays
state
or
federal
estate
taxes
there
may
be
income
tax
consequences
for
the
recipients
under
will.
