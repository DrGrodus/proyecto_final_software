Tyrone
man
targeted
at
Heathrow
BY
MICK
NAUGHTON
SINN
Fein
Francie
Molloy
has
exposed
another
British
undercover
operation
in
London
this
week.
Molloy
revealed
that
young
nationalist
from
the
Coalisland
area
of
east
Tyrone
has
been
hounded
by
British
agents
both
at
his
home
and
workplace
in
Britain.
The
man
in
his
mid-
who
did
not
wish
to
be
named
for
fear
of
losing
his
job
first
became
suspicious
last
May
as
he
returned
to
London
from
Tyrone
where
he
had
been
attending
his
grandmother
funeral.
As
he
disembarked
from
flight
two
men
`Chris
and
`John
struck
up
conversation
with
him
about
the
problems
of
getting
regular
work
in
London.
Both
had
what
sounded
like
polite
Belfast
accents.
The
Tyrone
man
who
works
at
Heathrow
airport
Terminal
and
who
has
lived
in
London
for
four
years
thought
nothing
more
about
the
short
encounter
until
he
walked
into
his
local
bar
weeks
later
to
find
the
pair
drinking
together.
They
reminded
him
of
their
earlier
discussion.
After
that
the
pair
appeared
regularly
in
number
of
other
places
and
on
several
occasions
called
to
the
man
home
to
get
him
out
for
drink.
During
conversation
`Chris
and
`John
told
him
they
were
thinking
about
opening
bar
and
asked
if
he
would
be
interested
in
``regular
employment.
They
pressed
him
repeatedly
promising
`easier
money.
The
man
present
job
entails
him
doing
-hour
shifts.
He
said
he
wasn
interested.
However
at
the
beginning
of
this
week
on
Monday
evening
the
pair
concentrated
attention
finally
came
to
head
when
`Chris
described
as
being
of
heavy
build
declared
they
``worked
for
the
government
and
had
access
to
huge
sums
of
money.
The
worried
man
speaking
by
phone
to
this
reporter
from
north
London
location
on
Tuesday
morning
related
what
happened
next.
``After
telling
me
this
they
showed
me
photograph
clearly
taken
at
my
workplace
in
the
airport
at
am
this
Monday
morning.
They
showed
me
another
photo
of
my
brother
former
partner
and
they
said
they
knew
he
had
served
time
as
republican
POW
and
was
now
`working
in
England.
To
be
totally
honest
was
terrified
they
knew
so
much
about
my
movements
who
my
girlfriend
was
she
comes
originally
from
Co
Kildare
and
information
about
my
employer.
``I
was
so
nervous
at
being
alone
with
them
that
agreed
to
meet
them
at
pm
on
Monday
evening
at
bar
in
Heathrow.
was
due
to
start
my
shift
at
pm
so
they
clearly
had
checked
this
week
shifts
arrangements.
Hailing
taxi
they
said
they
would
leave
me
home
as
they
didn
want
`something
terrible
to
happen
to
me.
```Chris
then
showed
me
an
envelope
full
of
bank
notes
but
refused
to
take
it.
As
they
got
out
of
the
taxi
`Chris
threw
note
laughing
saying
they
would
`at
least
pay
the
taxi
for
now
told
the
driver
to
head
on
and
stopped
when
they
were
out
of
sight.
Even
though
the
fare
was
only
couple
of
pounds
gave
the
driver
the

asked
him
for
receipt
which
he
signed.
then
took
myself
off
phoned
my
employer
and
asked
for
few
days
holiday.
am
very
frightened.
rancie
Molloy
called
to
the
young
man
father
house
in
Tyrone
that
same
night
and
talked
with
the
British
agent
victim
by
phone
assuring
him
that
he
had
notified
human
rights
lawyer
Gareth
Peirce
and
an
Irish-based
lawyer
familiar
with
similar
threats
and
approaches.
Molloy
has
also
given
him
contact
number
in
London
where
he
can
be
reached
during
Molloy
visit
to
London
this
week.
``This
is
disturbing
case
explained
Molloy.
``Over
the
past
number
of
weeks
other
victims
have
come
forward
but
requested
no
publicity.
Worringly
these
approaches
have
increased
from
the
murder
of
Diarmuid
Neill
on
September.
It
is
clearly
signal
from
MI
and
other
covert
agencies
that
they
are
intent
on
targeting
the
Irish
community
in
England.
What
other
shattered
lives
are
they
leaving
by
these
heavy-handed
oppressive
tactics
would
appeal
for
anyone
caught
in
similar
trap
to
contact
lawyer
or
public
representative
to
document
their
activities.
Not
to
do
so
entails
life
of
manipulation
and
misery
at
the
hands
of
government
dismissive
of
people
human
rights.

Once
