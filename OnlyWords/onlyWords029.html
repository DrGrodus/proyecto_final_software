Summary
The
most
important
new
feature
in
is
the
ability
to
easily
offline
program
applications
using
Workspace
geometry
point
paths.
The
applications
include
spot
welding
arc
welding
paint
spraying
material
handling
sealant
laser
cutting
water
jet
and
deburring.
Once
the
geometry
path
has
been
created
and
saved
with
the
model
the
user
can
issue
Follow
GP
path
command
to
automatically
create
and
simulate
the
robot
programme
in
whatever
robot
language
is
currently
selected.
Tool
graphics
have
been
designed
to
simulate
each
tool
action.
Many
new
robot
languages
are
now
available
as
options
for
Workspace
including
ABB
Rapid
Yaskawa/Motoman
Inform
and
Inform
Sankyo
and
IBM
AML
PSI.
The
commands
for
editing
GP
paths
have
been
improved
as
have
the
commands
for
editing
geometry
points
editing
several
geometry
points
at
once
multiple
GPs
and
editing
teachpoints.
The
commands
for
editing
several
geometry
points
should
save
the
user
some
time
over
the
old
GP
edit
methods.
Many
of
the
new
commands
for
editing
teachpoints
are
useful
in
reverse
engineering
and
re-engineering
workcells
and
for
last
minute
touch-ups
of
robot
programs
during
offline
programming.
The
user-interface
and
the
efficiency
of
the
robot
and
tool
calibration
have
been
improved
while
the
Robotrak
setup
procedures
have
been
altered
to
increase
their
reliability
even
when
used
by
inexperienced
users.
In
general
the
changes
in
reflect
the
past
few
years
accumulated
experience
from
both
within
RSL
and
close
contact
with
industrial
customers
of
simulating
and
offline
programming
complex
workcells
using
Workspace
and
Robotrak
These
features
now
give
the
customer
an
affordable
user
friendly
tool
to
carry
out
the
most
complex
of
tasks
at
shop
floor
level
with
confidence.

that
the

and
that
the
repeatability
has
not
degraded.
The

have
been

away
from
the
Robotrak
units
then
returned
to
their
zero
position
that
the
repeatability
of
the
zero
reading
is
good.
This
command
displays
the
readings
for
all
three
encoders
on
the
screen
so
that
the
user
can
pull
each
cord
out
at
least
then
return
the
cord
to
its
zero
for
at
least
of
second
until
the
colour
of
the

changes
from
red
to
black
and

If
there

can
be
checked
for
repeatability
at
once.

The

then
has
seconds
to

and
further
seconds
to
prepare
for
the

The
command
is
structured
this
way
so
that
one
person
can
set
up
Robotrak

The

can
either
set

as
in

or
set
the
distances
between
all
three
bases
all
at
once
not
recommended
for
accurate
work
because
the
sharp
angles
of
the
cords
can
degrade
the
repeatability
of
the
measurements
and

contains
teachpoints
which
provide
an
adequate

of

for

the

must
be
flipped
for
good
calibration
and
that
the
teachpoints
are
not

that
would
degrade
the
accuracy
of

Joint

Other
Changes
The
cycles
times
obtained
with
Fanuc
robots
are
now
more
accurate
than
before
since
they
use
the
same
trajectory
generation
algorithms
that
are
used
on
Fanuc
controllers.
The
accuracy
of
the
cycle
times
for
other
robot
languages
should
also
be
improved.
The
tool
actions
described
under
Geometry
Paths
are
also
available
from
the
action
menu.
The
Workspace
signaldef
input
directive
can
now
take
just
robotname
as
parameter
though
the
old
signaldef
command
which
took
the
parameters
trackname
and
external
track
signal
number
is
still
valid
The
Workspace
signaldef
output
directive
is
no
longer
required
but
would
still
be
valid
is
used.
The
multiple
object
selection
sidebar
which
is
used
with
many
commands
contains
new
option
Path.
When
this
is
selected
then
the
user
chooses
name
of
geometry
point
path
and
all
the
geometry
points
on
that
path
are
selected.
The
Weldpos
and
Deburrpos
functions
are
now
available
for
use
in
Joint
expression.
They
work
in
similar
way
to
the
Grippos
function.
The
Weldpos
varies
from
to
as
spot
weld
gun
goes
from
full-open
to
closed
while
the
deburr
function
varies
to
and
then
returns
to
zero
and
repeats
all
the
time
that
deburring
is
on.
Macros
may
now
be
created
using
the
programme
structure
and
variables
of
the
Karel
language.
Create
macro
by
starting
track
and
then
issuing
commands
from
several
other
menus.
As
each
command
is
issued
it
is
stored
in
the
track
and
if
the
track
is
replayed
then
the
commands
are
executed
from
the
track.
Not
all
the
commands
on
the
menus
are
available
for
use
in
Macros
at
present.
