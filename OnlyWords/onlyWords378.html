After

by

or

the
party

has
the
right
to
have
the

by
higher
court.
This
process
known
as
the
appeals
or
appellate
process
is
the
subject
of
this
chapter.
Court
proceedings
prior
to
appeal
are
outlined
in
the
Process
of
Case
Civil
Criminal
Chapter.
The
court
system
in
general
is
covered
in
the
Illinois
Judicial
Systems
Chapter.
Appellate
courts
are
set
up
just
to
make
appellate
decisions.
So
too
many
lawyers
practice
only
appellate
law.
One
reason
for
this
legal
specialty
is
that
arguing
an
appeal
is
quite
different
from
representing
party
in
trial.
party
who
disagrees
with
judge
or

should
seek
the
advice
of
an
appellate

regarding
the
prospects
of
better
outcome
on
appeal.

What
Is
an
Appeal
Appeal
is
the
term
used
to
describe
the
process
by
which
higher
court
reviews
the
decision
of
lower
trial
court.
The
right
to
appeal
an
adverse
legal
decision
is
granted
by
the
United
States
Constitution
and
the
Illinois
Constitution.
This
appeals
system
provides
check
on
the
power
of
judge
or
jury.
Judges
who
interpret
the
law
erroneously
will
have
their
decisions
overturned
by
court
with
authority
to
do
so.
Judges
know
that
their
governance
over
every
case
may
be
checked
by
an
appellate
court.
Some
appeals
are
granted
only
at
the
discretion
of
the
appellate
court.
The
United
States
Supreme
Court
because
it
cannot
review
every
single
case
decided
in
the
federal
system
hears
appeals
only
at
its
discretion.
party
who
had
court
decision
made
against
him
or
her
is
the
party
with
the
right
to
appeal.
Only
under
very
rare
circumstances
can
party
appeal
favorable
decision
on
the
ground
that
he
or
she
disagrees
with
the
reasoning
of
the
decision.
The
party
who
appeals
is
known
as
the
appellant.
In
opposition
to
the
appellant
is
the
appellee
the
party
who
agrees
with
the
outcome
of
the
trial
and
who
will
argue
during
the
appeal
that
the
judge
or
jury
decision
should
be
left
alone.
Requirements
for
Appealing
Decision
Finality
Not
every
determination
made
by
judge
is
appealable.
Only
final
judgments
decisions
that
conclude
the
case
in
that
court
once
and
for
all
are
appealable.
If
particular
decision
was
not
final
it
is
not
time
for
an
appeal.
Throughout
the
course
of
any
civil
trial
the
trial
judge
may
make
numerous
decisions.
The
judge
may
rule
on
motion
to
limit
the
scope
of
questions
that
may
be
asked
in
deposition
or
may
grant
or
deny
request
that
the
case
be
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
there
is
insufficient
evidence
of
wrongdoing.
Any
court
order
that
does
not
complete
the
case
is
not
considered
final
order.
For
example
if
the
judge
denies
motion
to
dismiss
the
proceedings
will
continue
and
the
order
denying
the
motion
is
considered
an
interim
or
interlocutory
order
not
final
order.
On
the
other
hand
if
the
judge
grants
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
case
that
order
is
final.
decision
regarding
the
subject
matter
of
the
case
has
been
made
sufficient
grounds
do
not
exist
for
the
case
to
continue.
The
final
decision
also
called
final
disposition
final
judgment
or
final
order
disposes
of
the
case
as
far
as
that
court
is
concerned.
Generally
final
decision
is
made
after
hearing.
The
judge
or
jury
has
heard
all
the
evidence
and
it
makes
decision.
finding
that
the
plaintiff
proved
or
failed
to
prove
his
or
her
case
ends
the
litigation
at
that
stage.
The
final
order
is
appealable.
Timeliness
If
the
lower
court
has
not
yet
rendered
its
final
decision
the
appeal
is
not
appropriate.
For
another
court
to
give
its
input
into
the
proceedings
while
they
are
still
going
on
would
be
confusing
and
inefficient
for
everyone
involved.
Thus
only
final
decision
is
appealable.
The
right
to
appeal
though
does
not
last
forever.
Parties
are
bound
to
keep
things
moving
along
by
exercising
the
right
to
appeal
within
reasonable
length
of
time
after
the
final
judgment
is
rendered.
Like
statute
of
limitations
every
court
has
rule
dictating
the
length
of
time
after
the
final
judgment
during
which
an
appeal
may
be
made.
For
example
in
the
federal
system
federal
district
court
final
decision
generally
must
be
appealed
within
days
or
days
if
the
United
States
or
its
agent
or
officer
is
party
or
the
party
who
wishes
to
appeal
loses
that
right
forever.
Sometimes
there
is
question
as
to
when
the
final
judgment
of
the
trial
court
was
entered.
In
an
employment
discrimination
case
in
which
plaintiff
sought
back
pay
and
other
damages
court
issued
an
order
setting
forth
its
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
and
stating
that
judgment
was
for
the
plaintiff
and
against
the
defendant.
Some
months
later
the
court
issued
another
order
awarding
back
pay
and
retroactive
promotion
to
the
plaintiff.
Yet
another
order
was
entered
in
the
next
month
in
which
the
court
granted
the
plaintiff
attorney
fees
and
litigation
expenses.
question
arose
about
when
the
clock
started
ticking
for
the
defendant
to
file
notice
of
appeal.
Which
order
was
the
final
order
for
purposes
of
appeal
The
appeals
court
held
that
the
last
order
granting
fees
and
expenses
was
the
final
judgment
in
the
case
because
it
dispensed
with
the
last
of
the
issues
raised
in
the
plaintiff
complaint.
The
Scope
of
Review
What
an
appeals
court
has
authority
to
decide
is
limited.
The
appellant
must
outline
the
specific
question
it
wants
answered
by
the
appeals
court.
The
question
may
be
as
broad
as
Did
the
trial
court
err
in
deciding
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
or
it
may
be
very
specific.
Usually
the
appellant
asks
that
several
critical
questions
be
answered.
Historically
rather
than
filing
an
appeal
party
was
said
to
file
writ
of
error.
The
writ
of
error
was
request
to
higher
court
to
overturn
the
lower
court
final
decision
based
on
critical
error
in
reasoning
or
simply
because
the
decision
was
wrong.
plaintiff
who
loses
an
age
discrimination
case
for
instance
may
file
an
appeal
challenging
the
bases
upon
which
the
trial
judge
made
his
or
her
decision.
This
appeal
might
be
structured
as
Did
the
trial
judge
err
when
she
ruled
that
the
Age
Discrimination
in
Employment
Act
did
not
apply
Did
the
trial
judge
err
when
she
ruled
that
the
plaintiff
was
required
to
show
that
he
was
replaced
by
worker
outside
the
protected
age
group
Did
the
trial
judge
err
when
she
ruled
that
the
plaintiff
failed
to
establish
prima
facie
case
Because
appeals
are
structured
in
this
way
it
is
sometimes
said
that
the
actions
of
the
trial
judge
are
on
trial
not
the
actions
of
the
parties
to
the
original
litigation.
In
fact
the
parties
do
not
have
chance
to
re-litigate
the
case
before
the
appeals
court.
The
trial
level
is
the
only
opportunity
to
submit
evidence
examine
and
cross-examine
witnesses
and
argue
the
facts
and
the
law
of
the
case.
The
appeals
court
only
considers
whether
the
trial
was
conducted
properly
and
whether
the
outcome
was
reached
by
proper
application
of
the
law
to
the
facts.
As
noted
above
the
only
question
for
an
appeals
court
may
be
very
specific
such
as
whether
particular
document
should
have
been
submitted.
But
only
issues
that
were
raised
originally
in
the
trial
court
can
be
challenged
at
the
appellate
level.
The
body
of
evidence--argument
testimony
and
objections
considered
in
the
trial
court--is
all
that
may
be
considered
by
the
appeals
panel.
This
body
of
evidence
is
called
the
record.
Every
piece
of
evidence
and
every
argument
made
by
the
parties
lawyers
is
recorded
into
one
big
document
the
record
which
is
said
to
close
once
the
trial
is
over.
Once
the
record
is
closed
no
more
evidence
can
be
included.
Also
no
more
objections
to
evidence
can
be
made.
At
the
appeals
level
the
court
is
restricted
to
review
of
the
record.
party
cannot
offer
new
evidence
or
new
objections
for
the
appellate
court
to
consider.
The
age
discrimination
plaintiff
for
example
may
not
ask
the
appellate
court
to
overturn
the
decision
of
the
trial
judge
based
on
new
document
that
the
trial
judge
never
saw.
The
trial
was
the
only
opportunity
to
present
the
document.
On
the
other
hand
the
plaintiff
may
argue
on
appeal
that
the
judge
should
have
allowed
his
coworker
to
testify
as
long
as
the
plaintiff
made
that
argument
in
his
original
case.
He
may
give
the
appellate
court
an
indication
of
what
the
coworker
would
have
said
so
the
court
can
weigh
whether
the
exclusion
of
the
testimony
was
harmful
to
the
plaintiff
case.
The
Appellate
Decision
Because
the
appeals
court
only
reviews
the
actions
of
the
lower
court--not
the
actions
of
the
parties--its
decision
is
couched
in
terms
of
whether
the
lower
court
made
the
right
decision.
The
options
for
an
appeals
court
are
Affirm
The
appeals
court
may
affirm
the
lower
court
decree
judgment
or
order
which
is
declaration
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
was
right
and
it
will
stand.
Error
If
the
appellate
court
holds
that
the
lower
court
decision
was
erroneous
it
will
reverse
modify
or
remand
see
below
It
may
rule
that
the
mistake
was
harmless
error
which
means
that
even
though
there
was
an
error
it
did
not
affect
the
outcome
of
the
case
enough
to
make
difference.
Maybe
particular
witness
should
have
been
allowed
to
testify
but
the
testimony
would
have
been
similar
to
that
of
witness
who
did
take
the
stand
and
whose
testimony
did
not
carry
much
weight
so
the
jury
probably
would
not
have
found
the
excluded
testimony
very
compelling.
Excluding
the
witness
was
harmless
error.
Modify
final
trial
court
decision
may
be
affirmed
by
higher
court
with
minor
modification
that
does
not
affect
the
substance
or
general
findings
of
the
decision.
Remand
The
remand
of
case
is
the
sending
it
back
to
the
lower
court
with
instructions
about
what
the
lower
court
should
do.
Usually
remand
means
there
were
errors
in
the
trial
court
decision
to
such
an
extent
that
the
appellate
court
cannot
correct
the
errors
itself.
The
lower
court
must
reconsider
the
case
based
on
the
appellate
court
instructions.
Reverse
An
appeals
court
decision
to
reverse
case
is
ruling
that
the
trial
court
should
have
reached
the
opposite
conclusion.
finding
for
the
plaintiff
should
have
been
finding
that
the
defendant
was
not
liable
finding
for
the
defendant
should
have
been
ruling
that
there
was
enough
evidence
to
find
the
defendant
liable.
Unlike
remand
the
appeals
court
has
enough
evidence
in
the
record
to
make
determination
to
reverse.
Sometimes
the
appeals
court
reverses
and
remands
at
the
same
time.
In
this
situation
the
court
has
enough
information
to
reverse

its

but
some
questions
such
as
the

In

to
these
different
options

Appeals
Courts
and
Appellate
Procedure
The
Federal
Appellate
Structure
The
federal
appellate
system
consists
of
federal
circuits
each
of
which
has
one
appellate
court
called
court
of
appeals
and
the
United
States
Supreme
Court.
Within
each
of
the
federal
circuits
are
several
federal
district
courts
that
serve
as
trial
courts
for
issues
of
federal
concern.
Parties
who
are
dissatisfied
with
the
outcome
of
district
court
case
have
the
right
to
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
encompassing
that
district.
Illinois
is
located
in
the
Seventh
Circuit
thus
case
heard
in
federal
district
court
in
Illinois
such
as
the
Federal
District
Court
for
the
Northern
District
of
Illinois
would
be
appealed
to
the
Court
of
Appeals
for
the
Seventh
Circuit
which
is
located
in
Chicago.
Indiana
and
Wisconsin
are
in
the
Seventh
Circuit
also.
The
United
States
Supreme
Court
hears
some
cases
that
are
appealed
as
of
right.
Mandatory
appeals
to
the
Supreme
Court
are
made
only
in
cases
decided
by
district
court
composed
of
three
judges
chiefly
in
actions
to
enjoin
legislative
apportionments
on
constitutional
grounds.
Most
cases
reach
the
Court
by
an
application
process
known
as
petitioning
for
certiorari.
Review
by
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
requires
more
than
just
the
belief
by
party
that
the
wrong
decision
was
made
in
his
or
her
case
the
case
must
be
of
important
enough
concern
to
federal
law
that
its
issues
should
be
decided
by
the
Court.
Illinois
Appellate
Structure
Like
the
federal
judicial
system
the
Illinois
court
system
has
three
tiers
two
of
which
are
appellate.
Illinois
judicial
circuit
courts
are
the
trial-level
courts
in
which
actions
are
filed.
There
are
judicial
circuits
in
Illinois.
Circuit
courts
also
have
some
appellate
authority
as
final
orders
of
lower
tribunals
and
administrative
actions
sometimes
are
appealable
to
the
circuit
courts.
There
are
five
judicial
districts
each
of
which
has
an
appellate
court--the
court
with
appellate
jurisdiction
in
standard
cases.
The
judicial
districts
have
courts
in
Chicago
Elgin
Ottawa
Springfield
and
Mount
Vernon.
The
Illinois
Supreme
Court
is
the
highest
court
for
determining
important
questions
of
Illinois
law.
Located
in
Springfield
the
Illinois
Supreme
Court
directly
reviews
the
final
decisions
of
the
appellate
courts.
The
right
to
appeal
an
adverse
decision
is
granted
by
the
Illinois
Constitution.
Generally
the
appellant
must
file
Notice
of
Appeal
and
pay
filing
fee
within
days
of
the
final
order.
