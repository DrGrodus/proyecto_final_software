Summer
heat
is
hard
on
car
interior.
It
can
cause
the
headliner
ceiling
fabric
to
droop
the
padded
dash
to
crack
and
upholstery
to
fade.
Many
summer
related
problems
can

addressed

Try
to
park
in
the
shade.
Avoid
those
wide
open
spaces
that
allow
relentless
full
time
exposure
to
the
sun.
Try
to
park
near
building
to
assure
your
car
of
some
shade
at
least
part
of
the
time.
Finally
purchase
sun
shade.
These
inexpensive
cardboard
blockers
placed
in
the
windshield
and
rear
windows
help
lower
the
interior
temperature.
