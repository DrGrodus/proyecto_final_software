LATE-
SIGNPOSTS
POINT
WAY
TOWARD
INDUSTRY
TRENDS
OF
Executive
Summary
From
interviews
with
industry
leaders
and
analysis
of
recent
events
it
is
possible
to
connect
some
of
the
dots
and
make
educated
guesses
about
what
holds
in
store
for
wireless.
The
way
Larry
Vanston
sees
it
the
year
ahead
will
be
lot
like
in
the
world
of
wireless
telecommunications.
This
is
to
say
that
will
be
another
year
of
record-setting
growth
heightened
competition
and
rapid
techno-logical
change
for
the
industry
according
to
Vanston
president
of
Austin
Texas-based
consultants
Technology
Futures
Inc.
Vanston
and
other
observers
surveyed
by
WB
said
it
may
well
be
that
the
industry
is
in
for
year
when
the
pace
of
developments
if
anything
gains
more
momentum.
Such
an
acceleration
is
seen
occurring
across
broad
front--mani-fested
by
prices
for
services
driven
lower
as
more
competitors
arrive
on
the
scene
and
by
stream
of
technological
advances--and
against
backdrop
where
wireless
telephony
becomes
widespread
reality
in
more
markets
overseas.
But
this
is
not
to
say
that
there
are
no
clouds
on
the
wireless
horizon.
Indeed
renewed
signs
of
slowdown
in
the
U.S.
cellular
market--the
world
largest
in
terms
of
absolute
subscribers--have
dampened
the
growth
outlook
for
network
operators
and
for
handset
and
infrastructure
manufacturers.
As
Nokia
Corp.
noted
Dec.
Despite
improvement
in
Nokia
U.S.
mobile
phone
business
growth
and
profitability
in
Nokia
Mobile
Phones
have
developed
somewhat
below
plan.
That
sent
the
price
of
Nokia
American
Depositary
Receipts
tumbling
for
the
second
time
in
two
months
page
However
it
was
unclear
at
press
time
whether
handset
manufacturers
in
general
faced
repeat
of
the
overages
that
built
up
in
their
U.S.
inventories
during
the
Christmas
season.
All
the
same
Wall
Streeters
are
notoriously
fickle
bunch
and
any
fall-off
in
domestic
wireless
growth
should
be
measured
against
the
blistering
ex-pansion
that
the
U.S.
market
enjoyed
during
and
the
first
half
of
Net
subscriber
additions
simply
could
not
be
sustained
forever
at
such
an
ex-plosive
rate
and
cellular
long-term
growth
pattern
seems
firmly
intact.
By
the
end
of
it
is
conceivable
that
there
will
be
million
cellu-lar
subscribers
in
the
United
States--a
gain
of
million
in
-month
span.
...All
Eyes
Turn
to
PCS
Big
changes
are
destined
to
sweep
the
U.S.
wireless
market
this
year
as
the
industry
comes
to
grips
with
the
probable
enactment
of
legislation
aimed
at
deregulating
telecommunications.
This
would
give
network
operators
the
statu-tory
certainty
they
need
to
move
forward
with
big
purchases
of
new
equipment
said
Matthew
Flanagan
president
of
the
Telecommunications
Industry
Association
Arlington
Va.
Moreover
the
U.S.
market
is
on
the
verge
of
entering
new
phase
with
the
advent
of
broadband
personal
communications
services
PCS
It
may
be
another
year
yet
before
PCS
is
marketed
on
large
scale
but
PCS
licensees
are
betting
big
bucks
that
both
lower
price
points
and
the
digitally
enhanced
sound
quality
of
calls
placed
over
their
systems
will
prove
appealing
to
consumers
who
have
disdained
cellular
as
too
costly
and
to
at
least
some
cellular
subscribers.
This
year
challenges
for
PCS
players
will
be
to
finish
the
U.S.
licensing
process--the
C-block
spectrum
auction
see
page
is
set
to
resume
this
week--and
to
bring
newly
licensed
services
to
market
said
Tom
Mateer
vice
president
of
business
development
for
Sprint
Telecommunications
Venture
STV
the
al-liance
of
Sprint
Corp.
and
three
large
cable
television
operators.
Our
goal
is
to
provide
service
in
our
own
markets
by
the
end
of
Mateer
said
of
Kansas
City-based
STV
the
largest
of
the
A/B-
block

in
terms
of
potential
market
population.
Other
MTA
licensees
including
AT
Wireless

and

PrimeCo
L.P.
are
working
against
similar
timetables.
While
committed
to
code
division
multiple
access
CDMA
as
its
technology
standard
STV
had
not
named
equipment
vendors
for
its
network
buildout--estimated
to
cost
from
billion
to
billion
by
industry
sources--at
press
time.
Mateer
said
talks
with
prospective
suppliers
were
moving
along.
Some
funds
from
Sprint
long-anticipated
deal
to
sell
percent
equity
interests
to
France

and
Germany
Deutsche
Telekom
which
was
approved
by
the
FCC
last
month
are
expected
to
be
earmarked
for
STV
buildout.
On
the
narrowband
side
of
PCS
action
will
center
on
how
successfully
competitors
narrow
the
lead
that
Mobile
Telecommunication
Technologies
Corp.
Mtel
enjoys
in
this
market.
For
its
part
Mtel
continues
to
grapple
with
what
Alex.
Brown
Sons
Inc.
recently
called
rollout
concerns
surrounding
the
company
SkyTel
-Way
advanced
messaging
service.
...Competition
Consolidation
and
Convergence
More
of
the
Same
Only
More
So
Perhaps
the
most
important
issue
before
the
wireless
industry
is
how
to
compete
effectively
on
landscape
that
seemingly
keeps
shifting
beneath
its
feet.
For
many
wireless
players
achieving
scale
is
the
way
to
maximize
their
competitive
ability.
This
consolidation
trend
has
been
most
pronounced
in
paging
where
Arch
Communications
Group
Inc.
and
AirTouch
Paging
announced
the
most
recent
acquisitions
deals
giving
them
about
million
and
million
U.S.
subscribers
respectively.
Suf-fice
it
to
say
that
more
paging
acqui-
sitions
are
in
the
offing
this
year.
But
will
see
the
introduction
of
new
wireless
players
as
well
via
corporate
spinoffs.
For
instance
Sprint
spinoff
of
its
Sprint
Cellular
subsidiary

shareholders

on
track
for
completion

next

or
early

may
become

Inc.
the
only
privately
held
company
among
the
top
U.S.

has
hinted
that
it
may
go
this
route
and

Orange
its
U.K.
personal
communications
network

as
part
of
larger
realignment
of
its
telecom
interests.
And
the
cast
of
characters
getting
into
wireless
seems
likely
to
keep
on
growing.

has

on

For

the

MULTIPLE
SPECTRUM
AUCTIONS
AND
MORE
ON
THE
WAY
At
the
FCC
Dec.
open
meeting
Chairman
Reed
Hundt
hailed
the
prospect
of
simultaneous
spectrum
auctions
as
tremendous
accomplishment.
And
with
good
reason.
While
the
specialized

SMR
auction
that
began
month
ago
generally
has
moved
along
at
more
sedate
pace
the
C-block
auction
of
bandwidth
for
broadband
personal
communications
services
PCS
kicked
off
with
bang
on
Dec.
Net
high
bids
for
the
C-block
licenses
exceeded
billion
by
the
end
of
the
fourth
round.
One

an
astronomical

licenses
in
the
first
round
skewing
the
bidding.
But
the
hectic
activity
put
to
rest
at
least
some
doubts
about
whether
the
long-delayed
C-block
auction
would
measure
up
to
last
year

of
major
trading
area
licenses.
Meanwhile
SMR
operators
praised

to
auction

licenses
for

in

blocks
of
and
channels
in
the

band.
Also

adopted
as

BTA
licenses
would
be
auctioned

soon
as

from
now--with
credits
and

accorded

that
wish
to

provision
would
permit
the
processing
of
pending

applications
in
the

band.
The
other
NPRM
would
give
hospitals
access
to
vacant
television
channels
in
the
very
and
ultra
high-frequency
bands
doubling
in
many
regions
the
number
of
frequencies
available
for

Higher
