Misdemeanors
This
chapter
outlines
some
criminal
law
issues
and
focuses
on
misdemeanors
for
which
punishments
are
relatively
less
severe
than
for
felonies.
Felonies
are
covered
in
the
Criminal
Law
Felonies
White
Collar
Crime
Chapter
along
with
white
collar
crimes
the
rights
of
persons
accused
of
crimes
and
the
rights
of
crime
victims.
This
chapter
also
discusses
driving-under-the-influence
violations
as
well
as
the
juvenile
justice
system.
The
Family
Law
Chapter
covers
domestic
abuse
and
protective
orders
and
the
Process
of
Case
Civil
Criminal
Chapter
describes
criminal
procedure.
Private
causes
of
action
that
result
from
criminal
conduct
are
covered
in
the
Personal
Injury
Law
Chapters.
Criminal
Codes
Criminal
law
defines
conduct
that
is
prohibited
by
the
government
and
the
range
of
penalties
that
can
be
imposed
for
violating
these
prohibitions.
Depending
on
the
nature
of
the
crime
person
who
violates
criminal
law
incurs
penalties
including
fines
and/or
imprisonment.
By
definition
misdemeanors
are
crimes
for
which
person
may
be
committed
to
no
more
than
one
year
of
imprisonment.
Illinois
also
has
laws
that
allow
the
authorities
to
seize
property
connected
with
the
commission
of
crime.
For
example
person
convicted
repeatedly
for
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
may
have
his
or
her
driver
license
confiscated
and
driving
privileges
revoked
by
the
government.
Similarly
person
charged
with
violating
laws
connected
with
controlled
substances
must
forfeit
the
substances
as
well
as
the
raw
materials
used
to
make
the
drugs
vehicles
and
real
property
used
to
further
the
crime
and
any
money
or
other
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
the
controlled
substances.
Every
crime
is
defined
by
list
of
elements.
In
criminal
trial
the
prosecutor
attempts
to
prove
all
the
elements
of
the
crime
the
person
is
accused
of
committing.
If
all
elements
are
proven
the
judge
or
the
jury
finds
the
person
guilty
of
the
crime.
However
even
for
minor
criminal
violations
the
accused
may
not
be
found
guilty
unless
the
jury
or
judge
finds
him
or
her
guilty
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
Attempt
Conspiracy
Aiding
and
Abetting
Anyone
who
with
intent
to
commit
crime
takes
substantial
step
toward
committing
the
crime
may
be
guilty
of
attempt
to
commit
crime.
Merely
thinking
about
committing
crime
or
even
preparing
to
commit
crime
is
not
an
attempt
there
must
be
substantial
step.
For
example
if
group
of
teenagers
talks
about
how
easy
they
think
it
would
be
to
walk
out
of
store
with
pair
of
jeans
they
have
not
committed
crime
nor
have
they
committed
an
attempted
crime.
However
if
they
deactivate
store
alarm
system
so
it
cannot
detect
what
passes
through
the
doors
they
probably
have
committed
tampering
or
vandalism
crime
as
well
as
attempted
theft.
They
have
taken
substantial
step
toward
the
commission
of
the
theft.
The
law
of
conspiracy
and
the
law
of
aiding
and
abetting
are
other
general
doctrines
that
apply
to
wide
range
of
offenses.
Conspiracy
is
an
agreement
between
two
or
more
persons
to
commit
crime.
For
example
if
three
people
conspire
to
preclude
all
potential
renters
who
fall
within
protected
group
from
renting
apartments
in
their
building
and
if
the
apartment
manager
actually
rejects
those
people
they
all
can
be
charged
with
both
conspiracy
and
violating
the
civil
rights
law.
Even
if
conspirator
backs
out
of
the
conspiracy
but
the
other
conspirators
commit
the
crime
all
conspirators
may
be
criminally
liable
if
the
acts
were
reasonably
foreseeable.
person
who
aids
or
advises
another
in
committing
crime
may
be
guilty
of
aiding
and
abetting
and
may
be
criminally
liable
for
the
acts
of
the
other
person
as
well.
Thus
if
someone
intentionally
advises
another
how
to
commit
crime
both
people
are
equally
liable
under
the
law.
Misdemeanors
Criminal
codes
penalize
variety
of
activities
and
many
offenses
are
listed
as
violations
of
the
law
under
the
Illinois
Criminal
Code.
Under
the
Criminal
Code
misdemeanors
range
from
unlawfully
interfering
with
public
utility
to
criminal
trespass
to
residence
vehicle
or
real
property
to
intentionally
damaging
traffic
sign
or
traffic
light.
Under
the
law
many
crimes
are
misdemeanors
on
the
first
offense
but
become
felonies
on
the
second
offense.
This
means
that
for
example
retail
theft
of
property
valued
at
less
than
is
misdemeanor
the
first
time.
If
person
already
has
been
convicted
of
retail
theft
shoplifting
and
is
arrested
again
for
similar
action
the
person
will
be
charged
with
felony
retail
theft.
As
mentioned
misdemeanors
usually
carry
maximum
punishment
of
fine
and
less
than
one
year
of
incarceration.
Crimes
for
which
person
may
be
punished
by
more
than
one
year
in
jail
or
in
prison
are
categorized
in
Illinois
as
felonies.
Crimes
Causing
Harm
to
Property
Theft
burglary
and
robbery
are
felonies
in
Illinois
unless
the
value
of
the
property
taken
is
under
Similarly
whether
crime
against
property
is
charged
as
misdemeanor
or
felony
depends
on
the
value
of
the
property
taken
or
damaged.
The
statute
prohibiting
criminal
damage
to
property
for
example
proscribes
knowingly
or
recklessly
damaging
another
property
setting
fire
on
another
property
injuring
another
domestic
animal
and
setting
stink
bomb
or
other
offensive-smelling
compound
on
another
property.
If
the
damage
to
the
property
is
no
more
than
these
crimes
are
misdemeanors
if
the
damage
equals
more
than
the
crimes
are
felonies.
Similarly
criminal
defacement
of
property
is
knowingly
damaging
another
property
with
paint
an
etching
tool
writing
instrument
or
similar
device
the
severity
of
punishment
depends
on
the
level
of
offense
which
is
misdemeanor
or
felony
depending
on
whether
the
property
damage
exceeds
In
contrast
trespass
to
another
person
property
generally
is
misdemeanor
while
arson
is
always
felony.
Civil
Rights
Crimes
The
Illinois
Human
Rights
Act
forbids
discrimination
in
employment
housing
financial
credit
and
public
accommodations
on
the
basis
of
age
ancestry
citizenship
color
disability
marital
status
national
origin
race
religion
sex
or
unfavorable
military
discharge.
Violation
of
these
prohibitions
can
subject
the
violator
to
criminal
prosecution.
Sex
Crimes
Some
actions
involving
sex
are
illegal
misdemeanors
under
Illinois
law
unless
the
person
charged
has
been
convicted
of
previous
offense
or
unless
child
is
involved
in
which
case
they
are
felonies
that
carry
more
severe
punishment.
Prostitution
pimping
and
solicitation
are
misdemeanors.
It
is
criminal
sexual
abuse
sometimes
called
statutory
rape
for
any
one
to
have
sexual
penetration
or
sexual
conduct
with
victim
under
the
age
of
Criminal
sexual
abuse
also
can
be
sexual
conduct
other
than
sexual
penetration
in
which
force
is
used
or
the
victim
was
unable
to
consent.
Alcohol
and
Drug-Related
Traffic
Offenses
Alcohol
and
drug-related
traffic
offenses
commonly
known
as
driving
under
the
influence
DUI
are
frequently
prosecuted
crimes
in
Illinois.
If
person

BAC
is
or
greater
and
the
person
is
in
physical
control
of
motor
vehicle
he
or
she
is
considered
to
be
driving
under
the
influence.
Even
if
person

is
more
than
but
less
than
the
person
may
face
DUI
charges
if
there
is
other
evidence
to
show

It
is
DUI-related
offense
to
carry
alcoholic
beverages
in
vehicle
unless
the
beverages
are
sealed
in
the
original
containers.
person
also
can
be
held
liable
for
serving
alcohol
to
someone
who
commits
DUI
offense.
person
age
or
over
who
is
convicted
of
DUI
the
first
time
faces
mandatory
sentence
of
losing
driving
privileges
for
at
least
one
year
as
well
as
possible
imprisonment.
If
the
person
had
child
in
the
car
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
the
judge
must
add
to
the
punishment
fine
of
to

five
days
of
community
service.
Subsequent
convictions
carry
increased
jail
time
higher
fines
mandatory
community
service
for
ten
days
and/or
loss
of
driving
privileges
for
up
to
six
years.
Illinois
recently
began
zero
tolerance
campaign
to
address
the
problem
of
DUI
especially
among
drivers
under
age
The
first
time
person
under
age
is
convicted
of
DUI
he
or
she
automatically
loses
driving
privileges
for
two
years
and
may
face
imprisonment
and
fine
as
well.
Subsequent
convictions
have
more
severe
mandatory
penalties.
For
drivers
under
age
zero
tolerance
means
it
is
illegal
to
drive
with
BAC
of
more
than
even
if
the
BAC
is
not
as
high
as
what
some
people
consider
enough
to
make
them
intoxicated.
For
the
first
such
offense
driver
automatically
loses
his
or
her
license
for
three
months
for
subsequent
offenses
he
or
she
loses
driving
privileges
for
one
year.
Refusing
to
submit
to
chemical
testing
for
BAC
also
carries
with
it
mandatory
suspension
of
driving
privileges.
Other
alcohol
or
drug-related
traffic
offenses
include
reckless
homicide
discussed
in
the
Criminal
Law
Felonies
White
Collar
Crime
Chapter
under

and
aggravated
DUI.
Aggravated

minimum
fine
of
and
possible
imprisonment
for

Numerous
other
offenses
connected
to
DUI
are
misdemeanors
in
Illinois.
Offenses
include
Falsifying
driver

Failing
to
carry
valid
automobile
insurance
Allowing
one

drinking
alcoholic
beverages
Allowing

Juveniles
and
the
Law
Illinois
has
juvenile
court
system
for
minors
that
operates
separately
from
other
courts.
The
purpose
of
this
separate
system
is
to
help
serve
the
best
interests
of
juveniles
rather
than
simply
punish
them.
Generally
minors
under
age
who
run
afoul
of
the
law
are
said
to
commit
delinquent
acts
rather
than
crimes.
The
distinction
is
one
of
words
only.
Delinquent
acts
committed
by
minor
are
called
crimes
if
committed
by
an
adult.
Minors
between
the
ages
of
and
who
commit
certain
crimes
such
as
first
degree
murder
are
prosecuted
as
if
they
are
adults.
The
most
significant
distinction
between
the
juvenile
court
system
and
adult
criminal
courts
is
in
courtroom
procedures.
Juvenile
courts
generally
are
less
formal
than
other
courts.
For
example
minors
being
adjudicated
or
giving
courtroom
testimony
in
some
cases
can
have
supportive
person
present
during
their
testimony.
Juvenile
cases
are
heard
in
an
adjudication
hearing
by
judge
who
determines
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
minor
accused
of
committing
delinquent
act.
Sometimes
these
hearings
are
closed
to
the
public.
Records
made
by
law
enforcement
officers
about
delinquent
minors
must
be
kept
confidential
and
separate
from
other
arrest
records.
Only
under
certain
circumstances
may
records
from
juvenile
court
be
used
in
other
legal
proceedings.
Illinois
has
strict
laws
that
seek
to
address
juvenile
gang
violence.
When
the
state
seeks
to
try
violent
juvenile
delinquent
on
criminal
charges
it
may
include
in
its
petition
evidence
that
the
criminal
activity
was
gang-related
and
the
judge
may
consider
this
evidence
and
order
the
minor
tried
as
an
adult.
For
example
if
-year-old
minor
allegedly
committed
forcible
felony
that
was
part
of
criminal
gang
activity
and
the
minor
already
was
declared
juvenile
delinquent
the
judge
will
order
the
case
to
be
heard
in
criminal
court.
Crime
Victims
Rights
Some
crime
victims
have
the
right
to
compensation
for
the
crimes
committed
against
them.
This
means
that
crime
victim
may
receive
compensation
for
certain
expenses
or
losses
such
as
medical
expenses
or
loss
of
support
if
the
crime
victim
becomes
unable
to
support
dependents.
There
are
requirements
that
must
be
met
for
victim
to
get
reimbursement
and
victims
must
file
an
application
for
consideration
with
the
Illinois
Court
of
Claims
for
compensation.
The
maximum
amount
victim
can
receive
from
the
Court
of
Claims
is
Under
some
Illinois
laws
the
victim
may
receive
compensation
from
the
person
who
committed
the
crime.
This
is
called
restitution.
For
example
person
whose
vehicle
is
stolen
may
be
able
to
receive
compensation
for
the
vehicle.
In
this
case
the
state
arranges
to
collect
the
money
from
the
criminal
and
sends
check
to
the
victim
when
all
the
restitution
has
been
made.
The
Illinois
Victims
Rights
Constitutional
Amendment
gives
all
victims
the
right
to
be
treated
with
fairness
the
right
to
privacy
the
right
to
make
statement
at
sentencing
and
the
right
to
reasonable
protection
from
the
accused
during
the
criminal
justice
proceedings.
Victims
of
the
most
violent
crimes
also
have
the
right
to
be
notified
of
the
status
of
the
investigation
whether
an
indictment
has
been
brought
the
time
and
place
of
any
hearings
and
when
the
defendant
is
released
from
custody.
If
the
court
does
not
order
restitution
or
if
prosecutor
does
not
press
charges
the
victim
still
has
the
option
to
seek
compensation
directly
by
suing
the
offender
in
civil
court.
This
option
is
discussed
more
fully
in
the
Process
of
Case
Civil
Criminal
Chapter.
