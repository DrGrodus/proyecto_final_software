return
the
sign
of
the
argument
nint
will
indicate
that
the
nearest
integer
value
is
calculated
of
its
argument.
int
will
indicate
that
the
truncation
of
the
floating
point
value
to
integer
is
calculated
of
its
argument
and
that
if
the
floating
point
value
is
less

Consists
of
one
file
for
each
scene
per
frequency.
Each
line
of
each
file
consists
of
azimuth
samples.
There
are
or
lines
depending
on
the
processor
each
corresponding
to
progressively
greater
range
from
the
radar.
The
azimuth
pixel
spacing
is
meters
for
the
pre-
prf
and
meters
for
the
and
later
prf.
The

The
first
two

three

in

The
difference
between
the
AIRSAR
CM
data
and
SIR-C
MLC
data
is
chiefly
that
for
AIRSAR
the
elements
of
the
Stokes
Matrix
are
stored
directly
to
each
compressed
byte
while
for
SIR-C
the
cross-products
that
when
combined
appropriately
comprise
the
Stokes
matrix
are
stored.
In
addition
the
AIRSAR
data
employs
general
scale
factor
while
SIR-C
does
not.
And
finally
the
value
stored
in
the
first
two
bytes
by
AIRSAR
is
the
total
power
divided
by
the
general
scale
factor
while
the
value
stored
in
the
first
two
bytes
by
SIR-C
is
four
times
the
total
power.
The
Stokes
matrix
and
Cross-Products
The
symmetrized
Stokes
matrix
may
be
formed
from
the
cross-products
of
the
scattering
matrix
that
are
stored
by
SIR-C
in
the
MLC
format
as
