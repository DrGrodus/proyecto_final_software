INTRODUCTION
During
much
of
this
century
the
mass
media
has
been
characterized
by
limited
number
of
speakers
transmitting
programming
and
information
to
essentially
passive
audiences.
The
communications
medium
of
the
twenty-
first
century
--
the
Internet
and
cyberspace
generally
--
is
changing
that
and
will
allow
hundreds
of
millions
of
individuals
to
engage
in
interactive
communication
on
national
and
global
scale
never
before
possible.
The
public
square
of
the
past
--
with
pamphleteering
soap
boxes
and
vigorous
debate
--
is
being
replaced
by
the
Internet
which
enables
average
citizens
to
participate
in
national
discourse
publish
newspaper
distribute
an
electronic
pamphlet
to
the
world
and
generally
to
communicate
to
and
with
broader
audience
than
ever
before
possible.
It
also
enables
average
citizens
to
gain
access
to
vast
and
literally
world-wide
range
of
information.
The
Communications
Decency
Act
CDA
or
the
Act
represents
Congress
first
attempt
to
regulate
speech
content
in
this
promising
new
medium.
Unfortunately
Congress
undertook
this
task
without
holding
any
hearings
regarding
the
likely
impact
of
the
CDA
on
that
medium.
In
the
name
of
protecting
children
from
inappropriate
material
they
might
encounter
online
Congress
clumsily
attempted
to
graft
regulations
developed
in
the
dial-a-porn
context
onto
this
very
different
indeed
unique
mode
of
communication.
After
making
precisely
the
kind
of
inquiry
Congress
failed
to
make
--
that
is
undertaking
five
days
of
evidentiary
hearings
and
considering
massive
amounts
of
documentary
evidence
including
extensive
stipulated
facts
--
the
three-judge
district
court
below
preliminarily
enjoined
enforcement
of
provisions
of
the
CDA
that
effectively
ban
indecent
and
patently
offensive
communications
between
adults.
Appendix
to
Jurisdictional
Statement
J.S.
App.
a-
a.[
The
district
court
unanimously
held
that
appellees
are
likely
to
succeed
in
their
claim
that
this
ban
violates
the
First
Amendment.[
That
judgment
was
clearly
correct.
Nevertheless
appellees
appreciate
that
this
case
raises
important
constitutional
questions
regarding
the
application
of
traditional
First
Amendment
principles
to
new
and
increasingly
important
medium
of
communication
and
therefore
recognize
that
the
Court
is
likely
to
grant
plenary
review
regardless
of
the
strength
of
the
district
court
decision.
Although
we
believe
the
judgment
below
could
be
summarily
affirmed
we
understand
that
in
this
case
of
first
impression
the
Court
may
prefer
to
engage
in
more
comprehensive
examination
of
this
new
medium
and
of
the
extensive
record
compiled
below.
We
agree
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
plenary
review
may
be
appropriate
even
if
as
we
believe
the
judgment
below
is
plainly
correct.
Accordingly
we
do
not
oppose
the
government
request
for
plenary
review.[
However
we
do
believe
it
is
particularly
important
in
this
case
of
first
impression
that
the
Court
have
clear
understanding
of
precisely
what
was
argued
and
decided
below.
For
example
the
government
did
not
argue
below
as
it
apparently
does
here
that
Sections
and
of
the
CDA
criminalize
indecent
or
patently
offensive
speech
only
when
the
speaker
knows
that
the
only
recipients
of
the
speech
are
all
under
years
of
age.
Moreover
the
government
jurisdictional
statement
frequently
ignores
dispositive
findings
of
fact
the
government
does
not
argue
are
erroneous.
Accordingly
we
submit
this
response
in
order
to
present
more
complete
picture
of
what
was
and
was
not
decided
below.
COUNTERSTATEMENT
OF
THE
CASE
A.
Plaintiffs/Appellees
in
These
Actions.
Appellees
in
these
two
consolidated
cases
represent
broad
and
very
diverse
spectrum
of
content
providers
service
providers
and
users
of
content
on
the
Internet.[
The
appellee
content
providers
include
individuals
small
non-profit
organizations
libraries
book
stores
and
other
speakers
on
the
Internet.
The
appellee
access
providers
include
small
or
non-commercial
Internet
service
providers
ISPs
as
well
as
the
world
leading
ISPs
and
commercial
online
services.
Collectively
appellees
engage
in
or
provide
access
to
an
enormous
variety
of
speech
on
the
Internet
e.g.
information
about
AIDS
awareness
classical
and
modern
literature
political
commentary
and
interactive
discussions
on
an
array
of
topics.
All
of
this
speech
is
appropriate
and
constitutionally
protected
for
adults
and
the
vast
majority
of
this
speech
is
appropriate
and
constitutionally
protected
for
most
minors
as
well.
Nevertheless
appellees
engage
in
or
provide
access
to
some
speech
that
in
some
communities
could
be
considered
indecent
or
patently
offensive.
Such
speech
includes
communications
that
contain
the
seven
dirty
words
found
patently
offensive
in
FCC
v.
Pacifica
Foundation
U.S.
information
about
sexual
issues
and
problems
and
images
that
depict
sexually
oriented
subjects.
Among
this
diverse
group
of
appellee
content-
providers
most
do
not
charge
money
for
the
speech
they
make
available
over
the
Internet
some
appellees
provide
and
charge
for
access
to
the
Internet
or
to
an
online
service
Thus
users
around
the
world
generally
can
access
appellees
speech
on
the
Internet
free
of
charge.
Like
other
online
speakers
appellees
generally
seek
to
make
their
speech
available
to
the
broadest
possible
audience
including
listeners
within
and
outside
of
the
United
States.
B.
The
Three-Judge
District
Court
Decision.
Appellants
statement
of
the
case
entirely
omits
any
reference
to
or
discussion
of
the
extensive
and
unusually
detailed
factual
findings
of
the
three-judge
district
court
that
formed
the
foundation
for
the
decision
on
appeal.
See
J.S.
App.
a-
a.
The
Jurisdictional
Statement
fails
to
acknowledge
the
district
court
critical
factual
findings
that
it
is
impossible
or
infeasible
for
most
Internet
speakers
to
comply
with
the
CDA
affirmative
defenses
because
of
the
global
nature
of
the
Internet
the
CDA
will
not
effectively
shield
minors
from
indecent
or
patently
offensive
speech
since
very
substantial
percentage
of
such
speech
is
posted
abroad
and
will
not
be
deterred
by
the
CDA
and
parents
can
use
currently
available
software
and
access
provider
options
to
control
what
Internet
sites
their
children
may
access.
These
findings
undergird
the
district
court
legal
conclusions
that
the
Act
effectively
bans
constitutionally
protected
speech
among
adults
would
not
substantially
further
the
government
stated
interest
in
shielding
minors
from
indecent
online
speech
and
is
not
the
least
restrictive
means
available
to
serve
the
government
interest.
Impossibility
and
infeasibility
of
compliance.
The
district
court
received
extensive
evidence
from
numerous
experts
and
other
witnesses
and
carefully
considered
the
different
methods
of
communication
over
the
Internet.
Based
on
this
body
of
evidence
the
court
made
its
general
factual
finding
that
[o]nce
provider
posts
content
on
the
Internet
it
is
available
to
all
other
Internet
users
worldwide.
J.S.
App.
a.
For
most
methods
of
communication
over
the
Internet
the
court
concluded
that
it
simply
is
not
possible
for
speaker
to
restrict
the
availability
of
his
or
her
speech
to
adults.
For
example
the
district
court
specifically
considered
the
ability
of
speaker
posting
message
to
USENET
newsgroup
to
comply
with
the
CDA.
The
court
found
that
messages
on
newsgroups
are
disseminated
using
ad
hoc
peer
to
peer
connections
between
approximately
computers
called
USENET
servers
around
the
world
J.S.
App.
and
that
the
dissemination
of
messages
to
USENET
servers
around
the
world
is
an
automated
process
that
does
not
require
direct
human
intervention
or
review
id.
at
a-
a.
Because
of
this
structure
the
court
found
as
fact
that
once
user
posts
message
to
newsgroup
that
message
becomes
available
to
all
subscribers
to
that
newsgroup
or
bulletin
board.
Id.
at
a.
As
the
court
below
found
content
posted
to
newsgroups
is
available
not
just
in
Philadelphia
but
also
in
Provo
and
Prague.
Id.
at
a.
The
court
specifically
further
found
that
individuals
posting
message
to
newsgroup
cannot
ensure
that
all
readers
are
adults.
Id.
at
emphasis
added
noting
that
even
the
government
expert
agreed
with
that
factual
conclusion
The
district
court
reached
the
same
conclusions
about
e-mail
mail
exploders
also
known
as
listservs
chat
rooms
and
MUDs
and
MUSEs.
The
court
found
as
fact
that
there
is
no
effective
way
to
determine
the
identity
or
age
of
user
who
is
accessing
material
through
e-mail
mail
exploders
newsgroups
or
chat
rooms.
J.S.
App.
a.
With
regard
to
mail
exploders
the
district
court
specifically
noted
that
even
the
government
expert
witness
agreed
that
no
current
technology
could
give
speaker
assurance
that
only
adults
were
listed
in
particular
mail
exploder
mailing
list.
Id.
at
a.
As
with
newsgroups
and
mail
exploders
the
court
based
its
finding
that
individuals
engaging
in
chat
room
discussions
cannot
ensure
that
all
readers
are
adults
in
part
on
the
fact
that
the
government
expert
agreed.
Id.
Similarly
with
MUDs
and
MUSEs
the
court
found
as
fact
that
participants
do
not
know
whether
the
other
participants
are
adults
or
minors.
Id.
at
a.
With
respect
to
the
World
Wide
Web
which
is
one
method
of
communication
on
the
Internet
the
court
found
that
[u]nlike
other
forms
of
communication
on
the
Internet
J.S.
App.
there
does
exist
technology
by
which
an
operator
of
World
Wide
Web
server
may
interrogate
user
of
Web
site
using
computer
program
called
cgi
script
id.
The
court
found
as
fact
however
that
content
providers
who
publish
on
the
World
Wide
Web
via
the
large
commercial
online
services
cannot
use
cgi
scripts.
Id.
For
those
speakers
on
the
Web
there
is
no
method
currently
available
to
screen
recipients
online
for
age.
Id.
The
court
concluded
that
all
of
the
defenses
advanced
by
the
government
below
are
effectively
unavailable
for
non-commercial
not-for-profit
entities
J.S.
App.
and
these
entities
constitute
the
majority
of
speakers
on
the
Internet.
See
id.
at
a-
a.
For
example
the
distinct
court
found
as
fact
that
credit
card
verification
is
effectively
unavailable
to
substantial
number
of
Internet
content
providers
as
potential
defense
to
the
CDA.
Id.
at
a.
The
district
court
similarly
considered
the
adult
verification
defense
and
found
as
fact
that
the
burdens
imposed
by
credit
card
verification
and
adult
password
verification
systems
make
them
effectively
unavailable
to
substantial
number
of
Internet
content
providers.
Id.
at
a.
Finally
the
district
court
found
as
fact
that
the
government
tagging
proposal
would
not
allow
speaker
to
ensure
that
listener
is
not
minor.
Id.
at
a-
a.
Chief
Judge
Sloviter
summarized
the
court
factual
conclusions
as
follows
we
have
found
that
no
technology
exists
which
allows
those
posting
[protected
but
indecent
material]
on
the
category
of
newsgroups
mail
exploders
or
chat
rooms
to
screen
for
age.
Speakers
using
those
forms
of
communication
cannot
control
who
receives
the
communication
and
in
most
instances
are
not
aware
of
the
identity
of
the
recipients.
If
it
is
not
feasible
for
speakers
who
communicate
via
these
forms
of
communication
to
conduct
age
screening
they
would
have
to
reduce
the
level
of
communication
to
that
which
is
appropriate
for
children
in
order
to
be
protected
under
the
statute.
This
would
effect
complete
ban
even
for
adults
of
some
expression
albeit
indecent
to
which
they
are
constitutionally
entitled
Even
as
to
content
providers
in
the
other
broad
category
such
as
the
World
Wide
Web
where
efforts
at
age
verification
are
technically
feasible
through
the
use
of
Common
Gateway
Interface
cgi
scripts
the
Findings
of
Fact
show
that
as
practical
matter
non-commercial
organizations
and
even
many
commercial
organizations
using
the
Web
would
find
it
prohibitively
expensive
and
burdensome
to
engage
in
the
methods
of
age
verification
proposed
by
the
government
and
that
even
if
they
could
attempt
to
age
verify
there
is
little
assurance
that
they
could
successfully
filter
out
minors.
J.S.
App.
a.
In
their
Findings
of
Fact
the
three
judges
below
found
as
facts
that
Many
speakers
who
display
arguably
indecent
content
on
the
Internet
must
choose
between
silence
and
the
risk
of
prosecution.
The
CDA
defenses
--
credit
card
verification
adult
access
codes
and
adult
personal
identification
numbers
--
are
effectively
unavailable
for
non-commercial
not-for-profit
entities.
J.S.
App.
emphasis
added
Ineffectiveness
of
the
CDA.
The
district
court
also
made
specific
factual
findings
demonstrating
that
because
substantial
percentage
of
all
of
the
indecent
or
patently
offensive
speech
that
is
available
on
the
Internet
is
posted
abroad
the
CDA
will
not
be
effective
in
its
claimed
goal
of
preventing
children
from
accessing
that
material.
The
court
found
that
large
percentage
perhaps
or
more
of
content
on
the
Internet
originates
outside
of
the
United
States
J.S.
App.
and
some
of
that
foreign
speech
is
sexually
explicit
id.
As
the
court
found
[f]oreign
content
is
otherwise
indistinguishable
from
domestic
content
as
long
as
it
is
in
English
since
foreign
speech
is
created
named
and
posted
in
the
same
manner
as
domestic
speech.
Id.
Minors
would
have
unfettered
access
to
all
indecent

patently
offensive
speech

abroad

Judge
Dalzell

the
CDA

certainly

from

Finally
the

Jurisdictional
Statement
entirely
omits
any
mention
of
the
extensive
factual
findings
of
the
district
court
concerning
the
variety
of
methods
by
which
parents
can
easily
and
inexpensively
prevent
their
children
from
accessing
indecent
or
patently
offensive
online
content
even
if
posted
overseas.[
The
court
identified
many
different
and
currently
available
software
programs
that
allow
parents
to
limit
the
Internet
access
of
their
children.
J.S.
App.
a-

Similarly
the
court
found
that
the
major
online
services
all
offer
extensive
options
to
allow
parents
to
control
what
their
children
can
access.
Id.
at
a-
a.
Given
these
factual
findings
which
the
government
has
not
contested
it
is
clear
that
the
three-judge
district
court
correctly
held
that
plaintiffs
had
demonstrated
likelihood
of
success
on
their
claim
that
the
challenged
provisions
of
the
CDA
violate
the
First
Amendment.[
ARGUMENT
I.
THE
DISTRICT
COURT
PRELIMINARY
INJUNCTION
SHOULD
BE
AFFIRMED
BECAUSE
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
NOT
CONTESTED
THE
FACTS
ON
WHICH
THAT
INJUNCTION
IS
BASED
AND
DOES
NOT
ASK
THE
COURT
TO
OVERRULE
THE
LONG-ESTABLISHED
FIRST
AMENDMENT
PRINCIPLES
ON
WHICH
THAT
INJUNCTION
IS
BASED.
As
noted
the
government
does
not
argue
that
the
district
court
findings
of
fact
are
arbitrary
or
otherwise
erroneous.
Nor
does
the
government
question
the
First
Amendment
principles
invoked
by
the
district
court.
Accordingly
the
government
is
simply
challenging
the
application
of
settled
First
Amendment
principles
to
undisputed
findings
of
fact.
A.
The
Government
Does
Not
Question
the
District
Court
Conclusion
That
the
CDA
Must
Be
Subjected
to
Strict
Scrutiny.
The
government
does
not
dispute
that
the
district
court
appropriately
subjected
the
CDA
content-based
restrictions
to
strict
scrutiny.
See
Jurisdictional
Statement
J.S.
Its
sole
argument
is
that
the
Act
can
be
upheld
under
strict
scrutiny
because
the
Act
directly
and
materially
serves
compelling
government
interest
in
the
least
restrictive
way.

the

Thus
nothing
in

the

furthers
this

makes
little

what

the

asserts
in
attempting
to
justify
the

on

The

Correctly
Concluded
That
Appellees
Had
Established
Likelihood
of
Success
on
Their
Claim
That
the
Challenged
CDA
Provisions
Are
Facially
Unconstitutional.
Although
the
government
now
attempts
to
separate
out
and
defend
individually
the
three
substantive
provisions
of
the
CDA
preliminarily
enjoined
by
the
district
court
this
is
not
how
the
case
was
argued
and
tried
below.
To
the
contrary
the
government
made
no
attempt
to
distinguish
between
the
three
provisions
essentially
conceding
the
same
First
Amendment
analysis
applies
to
all
three.[
The
entire
focus
of
the
case
--
from
the
perspective
of
not
only
the
court
but
the
parties
as
well
--
was
the
feasibility
of
the
CDA
defenses
and
the
Act
patent
overbreadth.
To
the
extent
any
one
provision
received
attention
it
was
the
display
provision
U.S.C.
That
provision
criminalizes
the
online
display
of
patently
offensive
material
in
manner
available
to
minors.
The
vast
majority
of
the
speech
criminalized
by
the
CDA
perhaps
of
the
speech
at
issue
in
this
litigation
is
criminalized
by
that
provision.
That
provision
unquestionably
violates
the
First
Amendment
as
both
the
three-judge
court
below
and
the
Shea
court
unanimously
held.[
The
Display
Provision
Imposes
Criminal
Ban
on
Constitutionally
Protected
Speech
Contrary
to
Well-
settled
First
Amendment
Precedent.
As
the
government
essentially
concedes
the
challenged
provisions
of
the
CDA
are
clearly
unconstitutional
unless
the
Act
defenses
effectively
enable
online
speakers
to
communicate
indecent
or
patently
offensive
speech
to
adults.
See
J.S.
That
is
so
because
this
Court
has
repeatedly
held
that
government
may
not
ban
indecent
speech
between
adults
in
order
to
advance
its
interest
in
protecting
minors
from
that
speech.
To
the
contrary
government
may
not
`reduce
the
adult
population
to
only
what
is
fit
for
children.
The
level
of

this
is

of

First
the

argues
that

available
to
the
small
subset
of
online
speakers
who

for

--
so-called

J.S.
The
government
introduced
limited

that
certain
commercial
pornographers
already
use
credit

or
adult
ID
verification
systems.
But
as
Judge
Dalzell
explained
these
providers
will
be
largely
unaffected
by
the
Act
precisely
because
they
already
require
credit
cards
to
obtain
access
to
virtually
all
of
their
posted
content.
Even
if
the
Act
were
struck
down
commercial
pornographers
would
continue
to
require
credit
cards
as
they
did
before
the
CDA
was
enacted
because
they
do
not
want
to
provide
their
speech

To
the
extent
they

finding
that

would
impose

J.S.

Id.
Based
on
the

the

concluded
that
[a]t

is
effectively
unavailable
to
substantial
number
of

Ignoring
the

to
the
contrary
the
government
contends
that
noncommercial
Web

can
take
advantage
of
the
Act
defenses
and
complains
that
the
court
did
not
adequately
discuss
the
availability
of
adult
verification
services
such
as
AdultCheck.
J.S.
The
reason
is
simple.
The
government
offered
very
limited
evidence
regarding
age
verification
systems
and
even
that
limited
evidence
was
not
based
on
personal
knowledge.
J.S.

There
was
no
evidence
how
many

how

they
are

Id.
There
was
evidence
however
that
adult
verification
systems
are
used
to
the
extent
they
are
used
at
all
only
for
accessing
commercial
pornographic

[which]
charge

for

Id.
Appellees
and
their
potential

obviously
would
not
want
to
be
associated
with

if
not

To

undermined
by

at

It
is
thus
not
surprising
that
the

ultimately
concedes
that
users

who
want
to
disseminate
their
constitutionally
protected

will
be
forced
by
the
CDA
to
switch
to
an
alternative
method
of
communicating
that
material
over
the
Internet
or
otherwise.
J.S.
But
requiring
speakers
to
switch
to
an
alternative
method
is
patently
unconstitutional
particularly
since
there
is
no
realistic
alternative
in
terms
of

The

than
it
can
single
out

See
Arkansas

And
in

Even
more

the

always
have
the
option
to
tone
down
their

so
that
it

J.S.
In
other
words
they
can
self-censor
their
speech
in

to
avoid

There
could
be

The
Act
Fails
Strict
Scrutiny
Because
There
Are
Less
Restrictive
Means
to
Achieve
the
Government
Stated
Goals.
Underlying
the
government
argument
is
single
premise
--
that
without
the
Act
minors
would
be
left
wholly
unprotected.
J.S.
See
also
id.
at
arguing
that
there
is
no
other
effective
way
to
vindicate
the
government
compelling
interests
But
that
premise
is
simply
not
true.
Indeed
it
is
completely
undermined
by
the
district
court
findings
of
fact
based
largely
on
government
stipulations.
The
district
court
concluded
that
market
forces
exist
to
limit
the
availability
of
material
on-line
that
parents
consider
inappropriate
for
their
children.
J.S.
App.
n.
The
district
court
made
extensive
factual
findings
regarding
the
availability
of
software
that
is
intended
to
enable
parents
and
other
adults
to
limit
the
Internet
access
of
children.
Id.
at
a.
The
court
noted
that
[t]he
market
for
this
type
of
software
is
growing
and
there
is
increasing
competition
among
software
providers
to
provide
products.
Id.
The
court
went
on
to
make
specific
findings
regarding
two
such
products
Cyber
Patrol
and
SurfWatch.
Id.
at
a-
a.
The
court
also
found
that
all
of
the
major
commercial
Internet
access
providers
--
America
Online
AOL
Microsoft
Network
CompuServe
and
Prodigy
--
offer
parental
control
options
free
of
charge
to
their
members
and
made
specific
findings
regarding
those
parental
control
mechanisms.
Id.
at
a-
a.
Each
of
these
findings
was
based
on
facts
stipulated
by
the
government.
The
court
also
discussed
PICS
the
Platform
for
Internet
Content
Selection
which
has
developed
technical
standards
that
would
support
parents
ability
to
filter
and
screen
material
that
their
children
see
on
the
Web.
Id.
at
a.
PICS
provides
the
ability
for
third
parties
as
well
as
individual
content
providers
to
rate
material.
Parents
can
then
screen
their
children
Internet
access
based
on
the
rating
system
they
choose.
Indeed
they
can
screen
out
all
speech
that
has
not
been
affirmatively
identified
as
appropriate
for
children
by
rating
bureau
the
parents
trust.
Id.
These
findings
too
were
stipulated
by
the
government.
Based
on
these
stipulated
facts
and
the
additional
evidence
it
heard
at
trial
the
court
concluded
that
currently
available
user-based
software
suggests
that
reasonably
effective
method
by
which
parents
can
prevent
their
children
from
accessing
sexually
explicit
and
other
material
which
parents
may
believe
is
inappropriate
for
their
children
will
soon
be
widely
available.
J.S.
App.
a.
As
Judge
Dalzell
explained
these
software
tools
afford
parents
options
to
protect
their
children
from
online
material
they
deem
inappropriate.
J.S.
App.
a.
But
even
without
such
software
parents
can
supervise
their
children
use
of
the
Internet
or
deny
their
children
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
medium
until
they
reach
an
appropriate
age.
Id.
The
government
can
support
parents
by
educating
the
public
about
the
benefits
and
dangers
of
this
new
medium.
Id.

at
concluding
that
informational
requirements
together
with
support
for
user
based
blocking
is
more
narrowly
tailored
means
of
limiting
minors
access
to
patently
offensive
material
on
cable
than
is
speaker
based
blocking
In
other
sections
of
the
CDA
Congress
determined
that
user
based
blocking
mechanisms
are
the
most
appropriate
means
of
regulating
content
including
indecency
on
broadcast
television.
In
Section
of
the
Act
Congress
directed
television
manufacturers
to
equip
their
products
with
feature
designed
to
enable
viewers
to
block
display
of
all
programs
with
common
rating
--
the
so-called
V-
chip.
Sec.
Congress

policy
to
encourage
the
establishment

The
fact
that
Congress
has
chosen
these
significantly
less
restrictive
means
to
protect
minors
from
indecent
material
in
broadcast
television
further
supports
the
district
court
holding
that
the
Act
is
not
narrowly
tailored.

C.
The
Non-Display
Provisions
of
the
CDA
Preliminarily
Enjoined
by
the
District
Court
May
Pose
Different
Questions
If
They
Are
Construed
As
the
Government
Now
Apparently
Construes
Them
on
Appeal.
The
government
did
not
argue
below
that
Sections
and
only
criminalize
the
transmission
of
indecent
or
patently
offensive
material
when
the
speaker
knows
that
the
only
recipient
of
the
communication
is
under
years
of
age.
The
government
now
contends
for
the
first
time
that
Section
applies
only
in
situations
in
which
person
transmits
indecent
material
to
another
person
knowing
that
person
is
under
J.S.
emphasis
added
If
we
understand
the
government
correctly
it
is
now
interpreting
Section
to
apply
only
when
the
only
recipient
of
communication
is
known
to
be
minor.[
Below
all
parties
assumed
that
Section
could
and
would
be
interpreted
to
criminalize
any
indecent
communications
using
telecommunications
device
when
the
speaker
knew
or
had
reason
to
believe
that
any
recipient
of
the
communication
would
be
minor.
Since
every
content
provider
on
the
World
Wide
Web
for
example
knows
--
in
the
sense
of
being
virtually
certain
--
that
some
recipient
of
the
message
will
be
minor
Section
creates
the
same
constitutional
problems
barring
speech
between
adults
in
order
to
shield
minors
from
the
same
speech
as
the
display
provision.
Accordingly
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
district
court
applied
the
same
First
Amendment
analysis
to
the
non-display
provisions
and
unanimously
concluded
that
the
[p]laintiffs
have
established
reasonable
probability
of
eventual
success
in
the
litigation
by
demonstrating
that
and
of
the
CDA
are
unconstitutional
on
their
face
to
the
extent
that
they
reach
indecency.
J.S.
App.
a.
Although
the
government
now
asserts
that
the
display
provision
and
the
other
provisions
require[]
separate
analysis
J.S.
it
did
not
urge
any
separate
analysis
below.
See
note
supra.
Based
on
the
arguments
that
were
made
to
the
district
court
its
conclusion
regarding
was
clearly
correct.
The
government
also
now
for
the
first
time
interprets
Section
as
applying
only
to
situations
in
which
person
sends
indecent
material
to
someone
he
knows
to
be
under
J.S.
It
is
not
at
all
clear
that
this
is
tenable
interpretation
of
Section
which
unlike
Section
does
not
expressly
impose
scienter
requirement
regarding
age.
If
we
understand
the
government
correctly
it
is
now
interpreting
Section
to
apply
to
communication
with
specific
persons
where
the
speaker
knows
that
the
only
persons
receiving
the
message
are
minors.
Below
all
parties
assumed
that
Section
could
and
would
be
interpreted
to
reach
any
patently
offensive
communication
knowingly
made
using
an
interactive
computer
service
where
the
speaker
sent
the
message
to
specific
persons
--
such
as
by
e-mail
or
mail
exploders
--
as
opposed
to
methods
of
online
communication
in
which
the
speaker
merely
makes
his
speech
available
to
anyone
who
wants
to
access
it
such
as
through
the
World
Wide
Web.
Under
this
interpretation
Section
imposes
virtually
the
same
restrictions
on
adult-to-adult
communications
as
does
the
display
provision
and
presents
the
same
constitutional
problems.
Not
surprisingly
the
district
court
unanimously
concluded
that
Sections
and
of
the
CDA
are
unconstitutional
on
their
face.
J.S.
App.
a.
Based
on
the
arguments
made
to
the
district
court
this
conclusion
was
clearly
correct.
In
summary
the
display
provision
clearly
violates
the
First
Amendment
because
it
bans
patently
offensive
but
constitutionally
protected
speech
between
adults.
As
understood
and
argued
below
the
other
provisions
suffer
from
the
same
infirmity.
If
the
government
is
now
definitively
and
officially
construing
those
other
provisions
to
apply
only
when
the
speaker
knows
that
the
only
recipients
of
the
speech
are
minors
this
Court
should
not
itself
undertake
to
review
ab
initio
the
constitutionality
of
these
newly
coined
provisions.
Instead
it
should
allow
the
district
court
to
reassess
those
provisions
on
remand
in
light
of
the
government
new
position.
CONCLUSION
Although
the
judgment
below
was
plainly
correct
and
would
warrant
summary
affirmance
because
this
is
case
of
first
impression
involving
application
of
First
Amendment
principles
to
an
important
new
medium
of
communication
appellees
do
not
oppose
the
government
request
for
plenary
review.

Thus
user
based
blocking
is
far
more
effective
than
the
speaker
based
blocking
required
by
the
CDA
because
only
user
based
blocking
will
prevent
minors
from
accessing
the
substantial
percentage
of
all
indecent
speech
that
is
posted
abroad.
And
unlike
speaker
based
blocking
which
effectively
prohibits
adults
from
gaining
access
to
the
blocked
speech
user
based
blocking
enables
parents
to
gain
access
to
the
speech
themselves
while
denying
access
to
their
children.
Two
judges
also
concluded
that
the
CDA
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
In
particular
Judges
Sloviter
and
Buckwalter
agreed
that
the
terms

judges
were
clearly
correct
notwithstanding
this
Court
distinguishable
decision
in

however
because
the

on
the
basis
of
its
First

holding
there
is
no
need
for
the
Court

The
government
wisely
has
not

its
argument
suggested
but
not
seriously
urged
below
that
an
intermediate
scrutiny
standard
drawn
from
FCC

be
appropriate
instead.
Clearly
such
standard
is
not
applicable
here
where
there
is
no
plausible
analogy
to
the
spectrum

the
Internet
characteristics
are
the
antithesis
of
the

that

Nor
is
the

by
the

and
intrusiveness
the
Pacifica
Court
found
noteworthy
about
broadcast.
As
the
district
court
found
accessing
online
content
requires
several
affirmative
steps
[c]ommunications

do
not
invade

Moreover
[a]lmost
all
sexually
explicit
images
are
preceded
by
warnings
as
to
the
content.
Id.
Thus
as
the
government
witness
admitted
the
odds
are
slim
that
user
would
come
across
sexually
explicit
site
by
accident.
Id.
In
the
context
of
strict
scrutiny
the
Court
should
consider
only
the
precise
interests
the
government
identified
and
urged
below
as
the
justification
for
the
law
it
should
not
credit
new
interests
advanced
only
on
appeal
and
as
to
which
the
court
below
had
no
opportunity
to
take
evidence
or
pass
upon.
Cf.
Edenfield
v.
Fane
S.Ct.
In
any
event
the
government
cites
no
legal
support
and
there
is
none
for
the
proposition
that
assisting
parents
or
children
to
use
the
Internet
is
compelling
government
interest.
Indeed
as
the
government
itself
notes
J.S.
the
evidence
shows
that
the
number
of
minors
gaining
access
to
the
Internet
is
rapidly
increasing.
And
to
the
extent
parents
are
concerned
about
their
children
access
to
inappropriate
materials
the
district
court
found
that
user
based
technological
tools
are
available
to
assist
them
in
imposing
restrictions.

The

the

If

Congress

that
the

For
the

reason
the
