In

Secretary

told

Ethiopia
has
made
progress
in
human
rights
during
the
past
five
years
but
the
United
States
wants
to
see
more.
One
of
the
areas
of
our
concern
is
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
the
treatment
of
journalists.
CPJ
report
is
based
on
fact-finding
mission
conducted
last
May

the
report
and
CPJ
board
member
and
Newsday
U.N.
bureau
chief
Josh
Friedman
who
wrote
the
report
introductory
essay.
Based
on
more
than
interviews
with
government
officials
journalists
and
other
sources
the
report
demonstrates
how
independent
journalists
are
regularly
harassed
censored
and
jailed
under
the
provisions
of
restrictive
press
law
enacted
in
The
repressive
climate
exists
despite
promises
of
press
freedom
made
by
the
Transitional
Government
of
Ethiopia
TGE
in
and
by
the
recently
elected
Prime
Minister
Meles
Zenawi
who
served
as
TGE
president.
Clampdown
in
Addis
which

on

--
the
day
Ethiopia
Parliament
reconvened
to
address
key
media
issues
--
made
several
recommendations
to
the
Meles
administration
and
called
on
the
United
States
and
other
Western
countries
to
take
more
aggressive
role
in
encouraging
the
Ethiopian
government
to
uphold
guarantees
of
press
freedom.
Secretary
of
State
Christopher
position
is
welcome
step
toward
what
CPJ
hopes
will
be
continued
U.S.
government
commitment
to
press
freedom
and
support
for
Ethiopia
independent
journalists
said
Kerina.
We
look
forward
to
the
time
when
the
Ethiopian
government
views
the
private
press
as
an
ally
not
an
enemy
in
the
democratic
process.
