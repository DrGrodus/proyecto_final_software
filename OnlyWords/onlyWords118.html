Refining
of
the
Ability
to
Tell
the
Truth
REFINING
OF
THE
ABILITY
To
tell
the
truth

They
were
on
collision
course
and
Lucia
Cordell
Getsi
was
only
small
child.
It
was
at
an
early
point
in
her
childhood
when
the
intelligent
independent
adventurous
Tennessee
girl
and
the
magical
illuminating
world
of
books
met
head-on
at
the
William
H.
and
Edgar
Magness
Community
House
and
Library
in
the
Middle
Tennessee
town
of
McMinnville.
It
probably
came
as
no
surprise
to
those
who
knew
her
that
the
second
child
of
Sam
and
Georgia
Cordell
flung
herself
enthusiastically
into
reading.
None
of
her
ventures
were
or
are
halfhearted.
As
small
child
decided
that
needed
to
be
stronger
so
would
carry
these
large
boulders
around
the
Illinois
State
University

Professor
of
English

And
when
decided
had
to
cure
myself
of
vertigo
which
had
since
was
seven
started
to
climb
the
faces
of
cliffs
near
my
home.
No
ropes
no
tools
no
nothing.
It
was
terrible
but
thought
needed
to
get
over
my
fear.
get
to
the
top
and
then
lie
down
and
crawl
back
to
the
edge
like
snake
and
make
myself
look
over-for
hours.
When
she
characteristically
made
up
her
mind
to
know
everything
there
was
to
know
in
the
world
she
pitched
camp
in
McMinnville
library
and
became
library
fixture.
With
ruler
she
measured
the
stacks
of
books
she
would
read
making
sure
she
completed
at
least
foot
of
books
per
week.
She
eventually
knew
every
shelf
in
the
Magness
Library
and
became
aware
that
knowledge
was
larger
than
the
library
only
when
she
perused
read
shelf
and
discovered
new
book
had
appeared.
She
loved
horse
books
dog
books
Nancy
Drew
books
and
books
her
mother
didn
want
her
to
read
such
as
Forever
Amber
and
Inherit
the
Wind.
She
read
books
at
the
library
at
school
during
church
sermons
on
the
porch
sitting
in
trees
and
at
night
under
her
bed
blanket
with
flashlight
until
morning.
For
all
the
literary
world
gave
to
Lucia
Cordell
Getsi
she
has
admirably
and
sufficiently
repaid
as
an
adult.
She
has
published
five
volumes
of
poetry
and
translations
as
well
as
poems
fiction
translations
and
critical
essays
in
or
refereed
journals.
Among
the
writing
awards
she
has
won
are
the
Capricorn
Prize
for
the
book
of
poems
Intensive
Care
the
Ann
Stanford
Prize
Pablo
Neruda
Prize
Bread
Loaf
Scholarship
National
Endowment
for
the
Arts
Fellowship
three
Illinois
Arts
Council
Fellowships
and
numerous
grants
and
awards
for
The
Spoon
River
Poetry
Review
which
she
edits.
Even
more
important
Getsi
shares
her
passion
for
the
written
word
with
students
from
elementary
school
through
college
graduate
school
and
with
the
general
public
of
all
ages.
Her
public
school
poetry
workshops
public
lectures
and
public
readings
of
her
works
have
ignited
interest
and
enjoyment
in
poetry
throughout
the
United
States.
There
is
bittersweet
irony
to
the
physical
and
mental
fitness
conditioning
young
Lucia
put
herself
through
because
she
was
barely
out
of
her
teens
when
both
capacities
were
put
to
the
test.
Her
mother
strong
intense
and
deeply
religious
woman
committed
suicide
just
days
after
Lucia
st
birthday.
Exactly
years
later
in
Getsi
-year-old
daughter
Manon
contracted
the
deadly
and
paralyzing
Guillain-Barr
syndrome.
After
many
months
of
hospitalization
followed
by
rehabilitation
therapy
Manon
recovered
although
she
continues
to
be
vulnerable
to
other
ailments.
Those
traumatic
experiences
plus
her
other
life
experiences
and
observations
have
played
key
role
in
Getsi
poetry.
Manon
illness
resulted
in
Getsi
writing
the
award-winning
Intensive
Care
the
creation
of
which
served
as
an
outlet
for
Getsi
anger
and
frustration
and
also
allowed
her
to
be
proxy
for
Manon
then-still
voice.
She
admits
that
being
able
to
write
about
the
experience
in
way
helped
save
her
own
life.
Books
were
young
Lucia
lifeline
to
other
worlds
her
escape
from
small-town
Tennessee
and
an
endless
source
of
experiences
and
information.
At
various
times
in
her
life
she
thought
the
information
was
her
own.
Once
as
an
adult
she
cut
open
an
infected
wound
on
horse
leg
squeezed
out
the
bad
blood
and
had
her
daughter
Manon
lead
the
horse
to
stand
in
the
creek
each
day
for
week
until
the
water
healed
the
wound.
The
horse
survived.
It
wasn
until
about
year
later
while
reading
the
classic
book
My
Friend
Flicka
to
Manon
that
Getsi
discovered
that
her
intuitive
knowledge
used
to
help
the
horse
actually
came
from
the
pages
of
that
book
which
she
had
read
and
reread
as
child.
But
Getsi
real
memories
experiences
observations
and
emotions
are
ingredients
that
produced
the
award-winning
poet
author
editor
and
professor
she
is
today
at
Illinois
State
University.
Although
her
careers
as
an
educator
and
as
writer
have
been
distinguished
for
years
the
honors
have
been
particularly
frequent
in
recent
years.
She
was
the
Poet
of
the
Year
in
Illinois
the
same
year
the
University
named
her
an
outstanding
researcher
and
last
November
Gov.
Jim
Edgar
presented
her
with
the
Governor
Award
for
the
Arts
in
the
individual
artist
category.
She
graduated
magna
cum
laude
in
English
from
Middle
Tennessee
State
University
and
has
master
and
doctoral
degrees
from
Ohio
University.
She
had
NDEA
and
teaching
fellowships
at
Ohio
and
studied
for
one
year
in
Germany
on
Fulbright
scholarship.
Her
first
book
was
translation
of
the
complete
works
of
Austrian
expressionist
poet
Georg
Trakl
followed
by
books
of
poetry
titled
Bottleships
For
Daughters
Teeth
Mother
Letters
and
No
One
Taught
This
Filly
to
Dance.
Intense
personal
experiences
have
not
only
been
the
subjects
of
her
writing
but
the
insight
Getsi
gained
during
those
experiences
and
throughout
her
life
continue
to
invigorate
her
poetic
juices.
But
experiences
and
emotions
and
observation
don
make
the
poetry
write
itself.
Getsi
spends
countless
hours
on
each
work
and
particularly
enjoys
the
opportunity
to
focus
only
on
poetry
while
in
residencies
such
as
last
summer
residency
at
the
Ragsdale
Foundation
in
Lake
Forest.
When
at

or
on
grant
all
do
is
write
she
says.
can
obsess
about
one
poem
for
weeks
if
want
to.
Often
ll
write
one
humongous
poem
and
then
the
filtering
starts.
There
are
huge
baths
of
imagery
thought
context
emotions
that
wash
over
the
original
images
thoughts
and
ideas
started
with.
Poetry
is
the
kind
of
art
that
needs
long
spaces
of
time
to
think
and
to
create
and
just
allow
the
fluid
movement
of
images
to
wash
over
the
whole
paradigmatic
axis
of
memory
the
whole
memory
self.
That
what
grants
such
as
from
the
National
Endowment
for
the
Arts
permit
artists
to
do.
But
now
the
stupid
totalitarian
people
who
are
scared
of
ideas
and
who
want
the
world
their
way
have
had
their
way
with
the
NEA
and
it
basically
gone
she
says.
To
write
book
of
poetry
takes
usually
five
to
or
years
but
Intensive
Care
was
an
exception.
It
took
me
from
to
about
or
When
first
started
writing
those
poems
it
was
very
cathartic.
The
poem
Nursing
was
written
when
was
in
such
rage
was
so
angry
the
kind
of
anger
where
you
think
you
are
going
to
melt.

at

profession
angry
at

who

rays.
During
Manon
first
months
of
hospitalization
none
of
her
body
systems
were
working
including
her
ability
to
speak.
She
communicated
by
spelling
words.
Not
vocally
but
by
having
her
mother
or
nurse
recite
the
alphabet
out
loud
while
she
indicated
by
blinking
letter
by
letter
the
words
she
wanted
to
communicate.

could

which
the
paralyzed
teenager
used
to
call
for
the
nurse
out
of

of
her
head-the
only
body
part
she
could
move
at
that
time.
As
result
Manon
could
not
alert
the
doctors
that
her

tube
was
twisted
and
she
was
in
great
pain
and
long
overdue

Her
mother
discovered
the
problem
the
next
morning.
She
addressed
the
nurses
in
Nursing

page
There
were
wonderful
nurses
too
of
course
she
recalls
but
the
poem
was
cathartic
in
dealing
with
those
bad
ones.
Some
of
the
other
poems
in
the
book
were
ways
of
funneling
unresolved
things
from
my
life
through
that
experience.
That
experience
cast
new
light
on
those
unresolved
things
the
kind
of
light
that
makes
meaning
in
life.
That
kind
of
making
meaning
is
what
makes
us
human.
Manon
still
weeps
at
her
mother
public
readings
from
Intensive
Care
and
to
this
day
there
is
still
one
poem
that
Getsi
cannot
read
aloud
without
choking
little.
The
book
for
her
is
my
experience
of
her
illness
she
says.
It
is
mirror
she
can
look
back
into
because
blessedly
she
did
not
see
herself
in
the
mirror
during
that
time.
At
the
time
she
looked
as
though
she
would
not
survive
and
did
not
let
her
see
that.
Although
she
continues
to
bring
poetry
to
classrooms
in
Illinois
and
elsewhere
Getsi
can
hide
her
disappointment
in
the
state
of
reading
especially
reading
poetry
these
days.
Poetry
just
isn
there
in
the
schools
she
says.
It
isn
in
public
schools
it
isn
in
the
libraries
it
isn
even
much
in
the
bookstores
except
for
specialized
bookstores.
Anything
that
requires
lonely
concentration
is
not
in
the
schools
anymore.
It
not
financial
issue
it
just
unnatural
to
our
contemporary
culture
to
be
silent.
But
poetry
grows
out
of
that
silence.
As
result
poetry
now
has
been
marginalized
and
hidden.
Reading
during
childhood
particularly
reading
poetry
can
introduce
children
to
new
worlds
of
information
and
insight
and
experience
that
can
ultimately
inspire
them
to
explore
their
own
ideas
and
feelings.
Children
Getsi
firmly
believes
need
poetry
and
art
and
music
and
drama
and
all
the
arts
in
their
lives
as
early
as
possible
in
order
to
have
the
greatest
benefit
throughout
theirlives.
But
the
great
power
of
poetry
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
too
many
American
schools.
Ninety
percent
of
the
teachers

Most
school
libraries
don
have
poetry
especially

It
because
students
aren
expected
to
go
in

and
if
they
do

they
don

they

tempts

the

at-risk

And
that
is

Getsi
says.
They

they

Writing
helps
to

They
