Imprisoned
Worldwide
For
Second
Consecutive
Year
Turkey
Is
Biggest
Offender
With
Jailed

WASHINGTON
D.C.--A
record
journalists
were
in
prison
in
countries
at
the
end
of
the
Committee
to
Protect
Journalists
reported
today
in
Attacks
on
the
Press
in
its
annual
book-length
survey
of
press
freedom
violations
around
the
world.
For
the
second
consecutive
year
Turkey
held
more
journalists
in
jail
than
any
other
country
as
the
government
continued
to
suppress
independent
reporting
on
the
Kurdish
conflict.
The
Committee
to
Protect
Journalists
today
called
on
Prime
Minister
Mesut
Yilmaz
to
release
Turkey
imprisoned
journalists
and
rescind
the
laws
used
to
punish
and
censor
the
local
press.
Turkey
surpasses
such
totalitarian
regimes
as
China
and
Syria
in
its
willingness
to
throw
journalists
in
jail
said
CPJ
Chair
Kati
Marton.
The
new
Turkish
government
should
demonstrate
its
commitment
to
democracy
by
releasing
our
imprisoned
colleagues
and
abolishing
Article
of
the
Anti-Terror
Law
and
Article
of
the
Penal
Code
which
are
inherently
incompatible
with
press
freedom.
The
number
of
confirmed
cases
of
imprisoned
journalists
in
exceeds
CPJ
accounting
for
--a
then-record
imprisoned
journalists
at
year
end.
The
increase
in
was
largely
attributable
to
the
recent
crackdown
on
independent
journalism
in
Ethiopia
and
Nigeria.
In
each
of
the
cases
documented
in
Attacks
on
the
Press
in
CPJ
staff
researchers
verified
that
the
jailed
journalists
were
imprisoned
as
direct
reprisal
for
their
reporting
and
remained
incarcerated
on
Dec.
Imprisonment
is
very
effective
form
of
censorship
said
William
A.
Orme
Jr.
CPJ
executive
director.
Attacks
on
the
Press
in
documents
that
at
year
end
At
least
journalists
were
in
jail
up
from
in
The
four
countries
with
the
highest
number
of
imprisoned
journalists
were
Turkey
Ethiopia
China
and
Kuwait
Vietnam
Peru
Myanmar
Burma
and
Nigeria
each
held
eight
journalists
in
jail
and
There
were
six
jailed
journalists
in
Syria
four
in
Indonesia
and
Algeria
and
three
in
Zaire.
The
Legal
Tools
Used
to
Imprison
Journalists
Though
the
political
contexts
of
these
imprisonments
vary
widely
from
country
to
country
the
incarcerations
of
journalists
fall
into
several
broad
categories.
Some
representative
cases
Turkey
Isik
Ocak
Yurtcu
the
editor
of
Ozgur
Gundem
Turkey
leading
pro-Kurdish
daily
was
imprisoned
on
Dec.
Charged
under
Article
of
the
Anti-Terror
Law
he
was
convicted
of
publishing
separatist
propaganda.
He
remains
in
prison
serving
-year
sentence.
Article
of
the
Anti-Terror
Law
defines
nongovernmental
accounts
of
the
Kurdish
conflict
as
proscribed
propaganda
publishing
such
independent
reports
is
criminal
offense.
Turkey
is
the
biggest
offender
in
this
category
but
it
is
not
unique
In
Ethiopia
and
many
other
countries
journalists
writing
or
broadcasting
reports
on
civil
war
or
ethnic
strife
are
accused
of
violating
broadly
drafted
hate
speech
laws
as
if
their
reporting
were
the
cause
rather
than
consequence
of
those
conflicts.
Peru
Eduardo
Sihue
Cano
graphic
artist
for
the
left-wing
magazine
Cambio
was
imprisoned
on
June
and
sentenced
to
six
years
in
prison
for
being
an
apologist
for
terrorism
crime
under
Peru
anti-terrorism
legislation.
Under
Peruvian
anti-terror
laws
Sihue
had
no
right
to
confront
his
accuser
his
attorney
could
not
review
evidence
beforehand
or
otherwise
challenge
the
government
case
the
judges
were
hooded
faceless
security
officials
with
limited
legal
training.
Sihue
remains
in
prison.
Again
Peru
is
not
unique.
Turkey
Kuwait
Algeria
China
Iran
Myanmar
Burma
Nigeria
Syria
Tunisia
and
Vietnam
also
consider
the
publication
of
news
stories
about
armed
insurgents
criminal
violation
of
anti-terrorism
laws.
Special
tribunals
with
unidentified
accusers
and
anonymous
judges
are
used
by
several
other
countries
including
the
United
Kingdom
for
prosecuting
alleged
terrorist
offenses.
Ivory
Coast
Cote
Ivoire
Abou
Drahamane
Sangare
and
Emmanuel
Kore
who
work
for
the
opposition
daily
La
Voie
were
imprisoned
on
Dec.
for
suggesting
in
print
that
President
Henri
Konan
Bedie
attendance
at
the
African
Champions
Cup
final
brought
bad
luck
to
the
losing
national
soccer
team.
The
two
were
sentenced
to
two
years
in
prison
for
offending
the
chief
of
state.
They
remain
in
prison.
Turkey
Indonesia
Central
African
Republic
Iran
Myanmar
Burma
and
Cameroon
and
many
other
countries
use
criminal
libel
and
slander
laws
to
imprison
reporters
who
write
unflattering
stories
about
the
president
elected
officials
spiritual
leaders
and
businessmen.
China
Gao
Yu
free-lance
journalist
from
Hong
Kong
was
imprisoned
on
Oct.
She
was
tried
without
counsel
and
sentenced
to
six
years
in
prison
for
leaking
state
secrets
about
China
structural
reforms
in
articles
for
the
pro-Beijing
Hong
Kong
magazine
Mirror
Monthly.
She
remains
in
prison.
Algeria
Vietnam
and
others
rely
on
similarly
arbitrary
and
vague
definitions
of
national
security
and
state
secrets
to
imprison
journalists.
Nigeria
Nosa
Igiebor
the
editor
in
chief
of
Nigeria
Tell
magazine
was
imprisoned
on
Dec.
He
was
arrested
by
six
members
of
the
State
Security
Service
at
his
home
in
Lagos.
Authorities
demanded
that
he
reveal
his
sources
for
articles
critical
of
the
government
and
accused
him
of
receiving
financial
support
from
outsiders.
Igiebor
arrest
and
detention
were
confirmed
by
numerous
CPJ
sources
in
Nigeria.
Government
authorities
still
deny
that
they
have
detained
him
however.
He
has
not
been
charged
with
any
crime.
In
Algeria
Iraq
Libya
Western
Sahara
Zaire
Zambia
and
other
countries
journalists
are
often
jailed
without
charges.
Authorities
also
often
deny
that
they
are
holding
these
journalists
in
jail
which
makes
it
difficult
to
confirm
many
cases
of
imprisoned
journalists.
Turkish

American
Journalist
Almost
all
of
the
journalists
prosecuted
for
these
offenses
are
nationals
working
for
local
publications
and
broadcast
outlets.
One
recent
exception
was
Aliza

American
journalist
working
in

bureau
who
was
charged
in
August
for
allegedly
contravening
Article

hatred.
Marcus

offense

on

by
the
military.
She
faced
up
to
three
years
in
prison
even
though
the
facts
in
her
story
were
never
contested.
The
charges
against
Marcus
were
dropped
after
her
trial

protests
from
prominent
foreign
journalists

Honorary
Chairman
Walter
Cronkite

the
case

with
then-Prime
Minister
Tansu

believe
international
pressure
made
big
difference
in
my
case

Turkish
journalists
don
get
the

level
of
international
support

Award
from
the

list
of
all
confirmed
cases
of
journalists
who
have
been
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
in
the
past
years.
More
than
of
these
confirmed
deaths
bore
all
the
signs
of
deliberate
political
assassinations
CPJ
reports.
Few
of
these
crimes
have
been
prosecuted
however.
The
five
countries
with
the

decade
were
Algeria

Colombia
with
deaths
most
in
reprisal
for
coverage
of
drug
trafficking
Tajikistan
where
journalists
were
killed
the
victims
of
death
squads
and
armed
insurgents
and
the
Philippines

transition
to
democracy.
