From
our
dietitians
Have
you
come
across
advertising
that
claims
that
the
calcium
from
plant
foods
is
poorly
absorbed
Spinach
is
typically
held
up
as
an
example.
While
it
is
true
that
we
only
absorb
about
of
the
calcium
from
spinach
due
to
its
high
oxalate
content
it
is
incorrect
to
assume
that
this
automatically
applies
to
all
vegetables.
In
fact
for
low-oxalate
vegetables
such
as
broccoli
turnip
kale
Brussels
sprouts
cauliflower
and
Chinese
greens
absorption
is
compared
to
approximately
for
cow
milk
for
tofu
for
nuts
and
seeds
and
for
legumes.
