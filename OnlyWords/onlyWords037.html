Whatever
the

in
robotics
it
is
essential
to
ensure
that
the
investment
training
and
operation
in
any
factory
automation

is
both
thoroughly
researched
and
accurately

With
the
introduction
of
WORKSPACE
these
pre-requisites
can
be
achieved
with
considerable
savings
to
the
small
and
medium
sized
customer
without
sacrificing
quality
but
achieving
economy
of
scale.
We
will
show
how
the
use
of
simulation
can
aid
each
step
of
the
process
from
the
development
of
an
idea
to
the
programming
of
the
final
choice
of
robot.
In
each
instance
an
example
from

will
be
shown
from

of
applications
and
questions
may
be
asked.
The
need
for
Simulation
The
techniques
of
computer
aided
design
CAD
have
found
extensive
use
in
improving
or
replacing
the
process
of
engineering
drawing
architectural
drawing
and
many
other
applications.
However
an
engineering
process
involving
many
more
moving
parts
can
only
be
fully
understood
through
the
process
of
simulation.
Early
developments
in
this
field
have
involved
the
computer
controlled
machining
centres
using
existing
CAD
systems.
Additional
software
is
used
to
take
the
original
CAD
engineering
drawing
of
machined
part
and
analyse
path
across
its
surface.
An
animated
simulation
of
the
movements
machining
centre
must
go
through
to
create
the
part
from
raw
block
is
then
displayed.
As
well
as
providing
visualisation
of
the
process
file
can
be
created
containing
the
required
instructions
to
the
machining
centre.
The
file
can
then
be
executed
to
create
the
part.
This
extension
of
computer
aided
design
to
computer
aided
manufacture
is
highly
applicable
to
industrial
robotics.
Simulation
provides
an
efficient
interactive
graphical
environment
in
which
to
improve
the
way
industrial
robots
are
programmed.
Ever-increasing
numbers
of
robot
installations
are
now
being
planned
using
computer
simulation.
Only
few
years
ago
the
cost
of
technology
to
achieve
these
aims
was
prohibitive
for
all
but
the
largest
organisations.
However
as
with
CAD
before
it
simulation
calibration
and
programming
of
industrial
robots
is
possible
even
on
standard
low-cost
PC
compatible
computer.
software
package
called
WORKSPACE
conceived
designed
and
developed
by
the
UK
company
Robot
Simulations
Ltd.
can
be
used
to
create
robot
installation
at
fraction
of
the
cost
of
existing
systems.
This
talk
uses
WORKSPACE
as
an
example
to
show
how
simulation
calibration
and
programming
can
assist
the
implementation
of
an
automation
project.
Using
Robot
Simulation
WORKSPACE
was
primarily
intended
as
visualisation
aid
for
those
engineers
and
managers
involved
in
the
process
of
designing
and
debugging
new
or
existing
robot
installations.
Benefits
such
as
the
ability
to
detect
off-line
collisions
between
robots
and
objects
and
ability
to
evaluate
and
optimise
the
time
taken
for
sequence
of
movements
off-line
have
proved
major
incentives
for
the
investment
in
robot
simulation.
The
core
of
WORKSPACE
and
the
more
expensive
systems
is
the
CAD
modeller.

The
next
step
is
to
install

or

into
the
model.
library
of
over
industrial
and
educational
robots
is
available
for
WORKSPACE
thus
allowing
an
engineer
to
experiment
with
different
configurations
in
the
prototype
workcell
by
simply
loading
robot
from
disk.
standard
robot
may
be
selected
from
the
library
and
placed
in

The
user
may
also
design
their
own
new
robot
modelling
the
flesh
with
the
CAD
system
and
defining
the
mechanical
linkages.
WORKSPACE
then
creates
the
kinematics
model
for
the
new
robot.
Operating
parameters
such
as
actual
scale
size
velocities
accelerations
and
joint
limits
are
all
simulated.
robot
program
can
then
be
created
simulated
and
downloaded.
Robot
programmes
are
created
by
selecting
the
required
operating
language
from
the
pull
down
menu
system
and
interaction
with
the
model
using
the
mouse
pointer.
The
graphical
interface
is
considerably
more
intuitive
than
most
numerically
based
robot
operating
systems.
For
example
it
is
possible
to
define
robot
position
relative
to
the
model
by
pointing
at
position
with
the
mouse.
The
robot
tool
might
then
be
automatically
reorientated
so
that
it
is
normal
to
the
plain
of
the
object
face
feature
which
is
particularly
useful
in
surface
type
applications.
Commands
are
also
available
to
carry
out
more
complex
tasks
at
the
click
of
the
mouse
cursor.
Some
examples
include
paint
spraying
or
applying
glue
evenly
over
given
surface
welding
along
seams
or
grasping
an
object.
By
using
these
commands
it
is
possible
to
write
program
very
quickly.
These
progammes
are
then
used
firstly
to
move
robot
in
the
model
to
produce
realistic
animation
in
shading
of
the
objects
due
to
an
arbitrary
light
source.
Features
such
as
conveyors
robots
mounted
on
traverse
units
carousels
AGV
and
machine
tools
may
also
be
simulated.
There
is
no
limit
to
the
number
of
programmes
to
be
run
concurrently
on
any
number
of
robots
or
their
associated
machinery.
The
resulting
command
information
will
be
combined
by
the
software
to
produce
one
complete
integrated
simulation.
Collision
between
objects
in
the
work
cell
are
reported
as
they
occur
critically
important
feature
from
the
safety
point
of
view.
WORKSPACE
calculates
the
time
taken
for
each
event
within
the
model
and
displays
the
total
as
cycle
time
By
rearranging
the
work
cell
or
experimenting
with
different
robots
and
end
effectors
on
the
simulation
this
cycle
time
can
be
reduced
to
minimum
thereby
maximising
the
number
of
production
cycles
that
may
be
achieved
during
working
day.
Once
the
robot
program
has
been
defined
and
evaluated
using
WORKSPACE
it
can
be
down
loaded
direct
to
the
robot
controller
without
the
need
to
use
postprocessor.
Traditional
methods
of
re-programming
robot
would
inevitably
mean
that
production
in
that
cell
must
stop
for
considerable
time.
In
addition
programming
may
have
been
by
teach
pendant
involving
an
unacceptable
degree
of
human
error.
By
first
simulating
then
downloading
downtime
can
be
reduced
to
the
time
it
takes
to
load
new
program
onto
the
controller
from
disk.
This
is
one
of
the
major
benefits
of
robot
simulation.
Robot
Simulation
Problems
and
Solutions
The
kinematics
involved
in
robot
movement
is
far
more
complex
that
those
related
to
XYZ
machining
centres
and
the
relationship
between
the
curves
swept
by
the
robot
end
effector
and
the
joint
variables
is
not
straightforward.
Additionally
for
robot
simulation
to
be
of
general
use
it
must
be
capable
of
simulating
wide
variety
of
robot
types
and
configurations.
Perhaps
because
of
this
the
most
beneficial
simulations
are
not
those
that
are
originally
drafted
by
using
CAD
system
with
additional
robot
kinematics
software
but
those
that
are
specifically
designed
to
cope
with
the
demands
of
complex
robot
structures.
To
calculate
the
position
of
the
joints
required
to
achieve
given
tool
position
and
orientation
it
is
necessary
to
use
complex
mathematical
algorithm.
Most
simulations
provide
algorithms
for
the
major
robot
types.
Unfortunately
these
algorithms
do
not
always
function
in
an
identical
way
to
those
used
on
the
robot
controller
for
example
in
the
selection
of
when
to
point
an
elbow
up
or
down
or
how
to
deal
with
degenerate
cases
when
axes
are
aligned
Robot
manufacturers
tend
to
be
reluctant
to
release
information
like
this
if
they
know
themselves
to
third
party
simulation
company
even
under
non-disclosure
agreement.
This
can
mean
that
robot
program
can
appear
satisfactory
when
simulated
on
screen
can
have
an
occasional
unforeseen
change
of
configuration
when
implemented
in
the
real
world.
The
answer
to
this
that
any
computer
simulation
cannot
be
substitute
for
acting
with
caution
the
first
time
robot
cycle
is
implemented
in
work
cell
as
safety
is
primary
concern.
Off-line
Programming
WORKSPACE
now
provides
the
user
with
unique
facility
for
translating
from
simulation
system
language
to
robot
language.
This
process
is
not
simple
task.
Usually
the
user
would
need
post
processor
to
translate
not
only
the
simple
structures
such
as
movement
commands
but
also
more
complex
structures
such
as
condition
handlers
repeat
until
while
do
subroutines
and
variables.
There
are
very
few
established
standards
as
the
robot
manufacturers
are
fiercely
loyal
to
their
own
operating
systems
over
those
of
their
competitors.
WORKSPACE
uses
highly
sophisticated
robot
simulation
language
in
order
to
create
compact
efficient
program.
This
language
contains
all
the
important
program
structures
mentioned
above
plus
large
number
of
functions
and
routines
which
are
specific
to
manipulating
robots.
For
example
it
is
possible
to
perform
pick
and
place
task
by
simply
naming
the
object
to
be
moved
specifying
the
position
you
wish
to
place
it
and
calling
routine
to
calculate
all
the
intermediate
moves.
WORKSPACE
has
number
of
robot
languages
in
library
as
with
the
robots
when
performing
the
simulation
and
at
the
start
of
programming
the
correct
robot
language
for
the
model
is
drawn
from
the
menu
and
the
translation
is
carried
out
simultaneously.
To
transfer
the
program
files
from
the
PC
computer
running
the
simulation
to
the
robot
controller
it
is
necessary
to
use
communication
link
or
by
copying
the
files
onto
disk
compatible
with
the
robot
controller.
Again
this
is
an
area
which
has
few
standards.
Even
the
standard
RS
serial
port
poses
problems
of
electrical
wiring
and
protocol
methods.
However
once
link
has
been
established
it
is
possible
to
receive
information
from
the
controller
and
translate
into
the
simulation
language
without
the
need
of
preprocessor
thus
allowing
the
robot
program
to
be
evaluated
and
improved.
Model
Accuracy
It
must
be
remembered
that
simulation
of
robot
work
cell
is
only
as
accurate
as
the
model
of
the
workcell.
Careful
measurements
of
objects
in
the
real
world
must
be
made
before
entering
the
parameters
to
the
CAD
model.
One
way
further
of
improving
the
accuracy
of
simulation
is
to
use
the
robot
as
measuring
device.
probe
is
attached
to
the
robot
endpoint
and
moved
to
corners
of
key
positions
in
the
workcell.
The
datum
or
calibration
points
could
then
be
loaded
into
the
model
and
used
to
reposition
objects
in
the
model
relative
to
the
robot.
Production
Time
When
planning
factory
lay-out
robot
simulation
is
only
part
of
the
story.
The
values
for
cycle
times
given
in
workcell
assumes
that
there
are
no
bottlenecks
elsewhere
in
the
production
process.
Scheduling
simulations
are
available
to
allow
the
whole
flow
of
materials
to
be
modelled
through
modelling
robot
workcells
as
black
box
components.
What
is
needed
is
the
complete
integration
of
scheduling
and
robot
simulation
so
that
ever
more
accurate
figures
for
average
production
time
may
be
obtained.
WORKSPACE
has
allowed
for
this
in
its
User
CAll
facility.
Future
Developments
Simulation
has
now
major
impact
on
the
type
of
software
supplied
with
robots
to
users
with
most
major
manufacturers
taking
strong
interest
in
marketing
their
own
branded
simulations
or
off-line
programming
systems.
The
graphical
interface
and
user
friendliness
of
WORKSPACE
has
highlighted
the
inadequacy
of
todays
user-hostile
text
based
robot
operating
systems.
WORKSPACE
is
capable
of
running
many
different
robots
from
different
suppliers
in
the
same
workcell.
It
is
now
possible
to
use
graphical
simulation
system
used
as
robot
operating
system
with
simple
point
and
click
selection
of
robot

positions.
New
robot
tasks
can
be
programmed
in

of
minutes
instead
of
days
or
weeks.
The
promise
of
flexible
automation
is
yet
to
be
fully
realised
but
the
expectation
of
the

for

as
reliable
as
the
