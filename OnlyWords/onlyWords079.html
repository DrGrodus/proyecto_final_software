more
for

than
you
likely

The
extent
of
destruction
already
wrought
by
the
burning
and
bulldozing
of
rain
forest
has
reached
such
proportions
that
it
now
threatens
worldwide
consequences.
More
than
acres
of
this
irreplaceable
forest
is
being
burned
off
each
hour
Real
Dangers
to
our
Climate
The
uncontrolled
burning
of
the
rain
forest
is
pouring
out
carbon
dioxide
faster
than
surrounding
forests
can
cleanse
it
from
the
air.
The
result
burning
rain
forest
is
major
contributor
to
the
greenhouse
effect
now
predicted
by
many
scientists.The

Tomorrow
Miracle

While
occupying
only
two
percent
of
the
earth
surface
rain
forests
support
well
over
half
of
our
planet
wild
plants
trees
animal
and
insect
life
--
including
vegetation
that
provides
quarter
of
today
drugs
and
medicines
for
the
treatment
of
everything
from
heart
disease
to
leukemia.Still
percent
of

forest
vegetation
has
yet
to
be
evaluated
for
its
possible
medical
value
Some
varieties
of
rain
forest
plants
are
known
to
possess
cancer
fighting
properties.
And
no
one
knows
how
many
other
plants
may
do
the
same
in
the
fight
against
cancer
and
other
diseases.Burning
the
Answers
to
World
Hunger
Without
trees
and
plants
the
delicate
lands
of
the
tropics
quickly
turn
barren.
Ironically
if
left
to
science
undisturbed
the
life-nurturing
rain
forests
of
the
world
could
help
produce
bumper
crop
yields
worldwide.
This
is
possible
because
scientists
are
learning
how
to
interbreed
our
main
food
crops
with
their
robust
disease-resistant
rain
forest
relatives.
Many
rain
forest
plants
also
produce
their
own
insect
repellants
--
harmless
substances
that
may
well
hold
the
key
to
nonpoisonous
insecticides.A
Threat
to
Over
Half
the
World
Wildlife
Rain
forests
are
home
to
at
least
percent
of
our
planet
wild
species
and
hardly
any
can
survive
elsewhere.
The
loss
among
these
species
--
from
the
howler
monkey
and
toucan
to
the
gorilla
and
red
eyed
frog
--
is
skyrocketing
as
they
are
squeezed
into
ever
decreasing
space.
