Most
computer
users
do
not
consider
the
online
world
replacement
for
other
sources
of
entertainment
according
to
survey
from
Intelliquest
Worldwide
Internet/Online
Tracking
Service
in
which
just
percent
of
respondents
described
cyberspace
always
or
usually
better
than

television.

in
April
and
May
the

Of
the
remaining
million
users
about
million
access

an
important
statistic
for
those
looking
to
exploit
the
Internet
as

entertainment
medium.
The

no
comparisons
between
the
Internet
and
printed
entertainment
although
