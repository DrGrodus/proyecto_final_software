Analysis
of
ACU
Ratings
of
Congress
NOTE
ON
VOTE
SELECTION
Four
categories
of
votes.
As
the
umbrella
lobbying
group
of
the
conservative
movement
ACU
tracks
wide
range
of
issues
before
the
Congress
ranging
from
taxes
to
abortion
from
ballistic
missile
defenses
to
term
limits.
Accordingly
the
votes
we
choose
to
rate
are
broken
down
into
four
general
categories
economic
and
budget
matters
social
and
cultural
issues
defense
and
foreign
policy
matters
and
issues
of
institutional
reform.
We
endeavor
to
analyze
roughly
equal
number
of
votes
from
each
category
so
that
we
can
obtain
comprehensive
picture
of
an
individual
Member
ideological
predisposition
based
on
votes
cast.
Votes
rated
on
ideological
distinction
NOT
most
important.
Within
those
four
broad
areas
ACU
selects
the
votes
it
rates
based
on
simple
criterion
does
the
vote
reflect
clear
ideological
distinction
in
the
Congress
Thus
the
votes
we
select
to
rate
are
not
necessarily
those
considered
the
most
important
or
the
key
votes
of
any
given
congressional
session.
And
they
may
not
be
votes
we
took
position
or
lobbied
on
during
floor
consideration.
They
are
chosen
for
one
reason
and
one
reason
only
to
provide
clear
picture
of
where
individual
Members
of
Congress
stand
on
an
ideological
scale.
Thus
for
example
the
vote
on
NAFTA
was
not
rated
though
it
clearly
was
one
of
the
most
important
votes
of
the
session
in
terms
of
legislative
impact.
The
NAFTA
vote
was
omitted
from
the
ratings
because
it
was
not
an
ideologically-driven
vote
many
conservatives
voted
yes
while
significant
number
of
conservatives
voted
no.
Similarly
many
liberals
voted
no
but
significant
number
voted
yes.
This
simple
but
important
criterion
is
helpful
in
understanding
any
perceived
differences
between
Member
ACU
rating
and
his
or
her
rating
from
other
organizations
which
provide
ratings
of
Congress
such
as
the
AFL-CIO
the
Christian
Coalition
or
the
Chamber
of
Commerce.
Vote
breakdown.
For
the
first
session
of
the
th
Congress
we
rated
votes
in
the
House
and
votes
in
the
Senate.
In
the
House
two
votes
were
double-weighted
final
passage
on
term
limits
and
the
Balanced
Budget
Act.
In
the
Senate
one
vote
was
double-weighted
the
Balanced
Budget
Act.
The

is
as
follows

In
when
the
Democrats
controlled
the
White
House
for
the
first
time
in
years
long-suppressed
liberal
legislation
came
to
the
floor
for
votes.
Even
liberal
Republicans
couldn
stomach
some
of
this
legislation
and
they
voted
with
their
more
conservative
Republican
colleagues
in
opposition.
As

for
Republicans
were
much
higher
than
normal
with
most
Republicans
posting

would
otherwise
have
been
expected.
In
the
exact
opposite
occurred
with
conservative
legislation
coming
to
the
floor
for
the
first
time
in
four
decades
it
was
the
Democrats
who
showed
greater
ideological

thereby
resulting
in
most
Democrats
posting
higher

than
would
otherwise
have
been
expected.
Meanwhile

resulting
in
some
scores
for

that
were
even
lower
than
usual.
