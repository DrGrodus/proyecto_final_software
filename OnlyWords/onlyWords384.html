For
centuries
people
from
around
the
world
have
been
coming
to
the
United
States.
They
come
to
work

an
education
escape
oppression
start
new
life
do
business
visit
friends
or
sightsee.
Over
the
years
the
United
States
has
seen
tremendous
diversity
in
the
countries
immigrants
come
from
and
their
reasons
for
coming
here.
In
response
to
the
incredible
demand
for
permission
to
enter
this
country
the
federal
government
has
established
complex
set
of
laws
that
determines
who
may
enter
this
country
and
for
what
reasons.
This
chapter
discusses
legal
immigration
and
travel
to
the
United
States.
United
States
Citizenship
United
States
citizens
have
right
to
travel
to
and
live
in
the
United
States
and
enjoy
the
fullest
protection
of
United
States
laws.
People
who
are
not
citizens
of
the
United
States
usually
must
have
visa
to
enter
and
may
not
enjoy
the
protection
of
all
United
States
laws.

and
even
if
both
parents
are

The
only
exception
is
that
children

to
foreign
diplomats
in
the
United

do
not
get

Anyone

Aliens
Immigrants
Nonimmigrants
and
Residents
An
alien
is
citizen
of
any
country
other
than
the
United
States.
person
who
comes
here
to
stay
permanently
is
called
an
immigrant.
Someone
who
intends
to
return
to
his
or
her
country
of
origin
is
called
nonimmigrant
even
if
he
or
she
intends
to
stay
for
substantial
period
of
time.
For
example
student
might
stay
in
the
United
States
many
years
to
complete
an
education
and
still
be
considered
nonimmigrant.
The
distinction
between
immigrant
and
nonimmigrant
is
crucial.
Permission
to
enter
as
nonimmigrant
often
is
easier
to
get
than
permission
to
enter
as
an
immigrant
so
some
people
are
tempted
to
claim
they
intend
to
return
to
their
home
country
in
order
to
enter
this
country.
The
Immigration
and
Naturalization
Service
INS
is
aware
of
this
temptation
and
often
will
deny
nonimmigrant
visa
application
to
anyone
suspected
of
wanting
to
remain
permanently.
Also
being
granted
nonimmigrant
visa
sometimes
can
make
it
more
difficult
to
get
an
immigrant
visa
later.
permanent
resident
is
an
alien
who
has
been
given
permission
to
live
permanently
in
the
United
States.
In
dispute
with
the
INS
over
an
applicant
true
intent
the
applicant
always
bears
the
burden
of
proving
intent
to
remain
here
temporarily.
For
some
people
this
burden
is
nearly
impossible
to
overcome.
For
example
the
spouse
of
permanent
resident
normally
must
wait
over
two
years
for
available
immigrant
visas.
If
he
or
she
claims
to
want
to
visit
only
temporarily
he
or
she
must
overcome
the
presumption
that
married
person
would
want
to
remain
permanently
with
his
or
her
spouse.
The
Visa
System
visa
is
stamp
in
person
passport
that
gives
him
or
her
conditional
approval
to
enter
the
United
States.
Most
matters
involving
visas
are
handled
by
the
INS.
Most
aliens
apply
for
visas
from
consulate
or
embassy
of
the
United
States
in
the
alien
home
country.
Citizens
of
some
countries
primarily
European
countries
and
Japan
may
enter
the
United
States
for
up
to
days
without
visa.
To
be
eligible
citizens
of
these
countries
must
show
the
INS
that
they
have
return
ticket
home
and
that
they
intend
to
engage
in
type
of
business
or
tourist
activity
that
would
be
allowed
under
Visa
described
below.
Canadian
citizens
generally
do
not
need
visas
to
enter
temporarily.
In
some
instances
they
must
obtain
INS
approval
in
advance
if
they
are
coming
here
to
work.
Congress
establishes
complex
set
of
quotas
that
limits
the
number
of
visas
that
can
be
granted
for
most
types
of
visas.
Whether
an
applicant
receives
visa
depends
on
the
type
of
visa
requested
the
applicant
reason
for
traveling
to
the
United
States
and
the
applicant
country
of
origin.
Probably
the
most
important
element
to
obtaining
visa
successfully
is
knowing
for
which
visa
category
to
apply.
For
certain
categories
of
visas
and
certain
countries
of
origin
an
applicant
can
wait
many
years
before
he
or
she
even
will
be
considered
for
visa.
Sometimes
the
wait
would
be
much
shorter
if
the
applicant
applied
for
different
type
of
visa.
Unfortunately
once
an
applicant
applies
for
one
type
of
visa
it
can
be
difficult
to
change
the
application
to
another
class
of
visa.
For
this
reason
it
is
wise
to
consult
an
immigration
attorney
before
applying
for
any
kind
of
visa.
Nonimmigrant
Visas
There
are
different
kinds
of
nonimmigrant
visas
identified
by
the
letters
A-R
available
for
persons
who
do
not
intend
to
remain
in
the
United
States
permanently.
All
nonimmigrant
visas
are
based
on
what
the
applicant
intends
to
do
in
this
country.

the

Immigrant
Visas
An
applicant
who
intends
to
stay
in
this
country
permanently
generally
is
admitted
either
on
the
basis
of
employment
or
family
connections.
The
main
exception
is
for
political
asylum
seekers.
Employment-Based
Immigration
An
alien
can
receive
permission
to
immigrate
to
this
country
on
the
basis
of
his
or
her
employment.
There
are
five
categories
of
employment
known
as
preferences
through
which
aliens
can
be
permitted
to
immigrate.
First
Preference
Individuals
of
extraordinary
ability
outstanding
professors
or
researchers
and
multinational
executives.
Second
Preference
Professionals
with
advanced
degrees
and
aliens
with
exceptional
abilities
in
science
art
or
business.
Note
Exceptional
ability
is
different
standard
than
extraordinary
ability
required
for
first
preference.
Third
Preference
Skilled
workers
professionals
and
other
workers
for
which
there
is
shortage
of
workers
in
the
United
States.
Fourth
Preference
Certain
special
workers
such
as
religious
workers.
Fifth
Preference
Investors
creating
employment
for
workers

the
investment
must
be
substantial
i.e.
between
and
Family-Based
Immigration
An
alien
can
get
visa
as
an
immediate
relative
of
United
States
citizen
if
he
or
she
is
child
spouse
or
parent
of
the
citizen.
In
addition
there
are
four
family-based
immigrant
visa
categories
First
Preference
Unmarried
children
of
United
States
citizens.
Second
Preference
Spouses
and
unmarried
children
of
lawful
permanent
residents.
Third
Preference
Married
children
of
United
States
citizens.
Fourth
Preference
Siblings
of
adult
United
States
citizens.
Each
preference
is
allotted
total
number
of
visas.
Generally
speaking
the
higher
the
applicant
preference
the
shorter
the
wait
to
get
visa.
Special
Classes
of
Immigrants
Some
groups
of
immigrants
receive
special
treatment
and
fall
outside
the
preference
system
described
above.
Diversity
immigrants
are
immigrants
from
countries
deemed
under-represented
in
the
pool
of
applicants
for
visas
throughout
the
years.
Under
new
program
implemented
by
the
INS
in
certain
number
of
visas
will
be
granted
to
applicants
from
low-admission
countries
and
who
have
high
school
education
or
two
years
of
training
or
experience
in
particular
occupation.
Refugees
and
asylees
also
receive
special
treatment.
person
is
refugee
if
he
or
she
is
outside
the
United
States
is
fleeing
or
has
fled
his
or
her
country
and
has
well-founded
fear
that
if
returned
to
the
home
country
he
or
she
will
be
persecuted
because
of
race
religion
nationality
membership
in
particular
social
group
or
political
opinion.
An
asylee
is
an
alien
already
in
the
United
States
who
like
refugee
has
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
if
returned
to
his
or
her
home
country.
The
president
and
Congress
decide
each
year
the
total
number
of
refugees
and
asylees
to
accept
into
the
country.
Occasionally
Congress
grants
immigrant
visas
allotted
for
individuals
from
specific
countries
according
to
political
factors.
Recent
programs
have
included
China
Hong
Kong
and
Tibet.
Entry
and
Exclusion
visa
only
gives
conditional
approval
to
enter
the
country.
Once
an
alien
arrives
in
the
United
States
with
visa
he
or
she
must
apply
for
entry
from
INS
officials
at
the
point
of
entry.
For
most
aliens
this
is
mere
formality
but
the
INS
can
exclude
persons
with
valid
visas
for
variety
of
reasons
including
communicable
diseases
physical
or
mental
disorders
that
pose
threat
to
others
drug
addiction
or
criminal
history.
Involvement
in
espionage
or
terrorist
activity
against
the
United
States
government
or
its
people
is
grounds
for
exclusion.
The
Secretary
of
State
also
has
broad
discretion
to
bar
entry
of
anyone
whose
presence
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
the
foreign
policy
of
the
United
States.
Sometimes
waivers
are
available
for
aliens
who
otherwise
would
be
denied
entry
for
certain
reasons.
For
example
the
child
of
United
States
citizen
may
be
granted
waiver
to
enter
to
receive
treatment
for
drug
addiction.
Getting
Green
Card
and
Becoming
Naturalized
Citizen
Becoming
permanent
resident
is
the
first
step
that
an
alien
must
take
to
become
naturalized
American
citizen.
People
with
permission
to
live
in
the
United
States
permanently
are
issued
green
cards
that
allow
them
to
work
with
few
restrictions.
permanent
resident
can
apply
to
become
naturalized
citizen
after
five
years
or
three
years
if
married
to
United
States
citizen.
The
INS
is
diligent
in
investigating
marriages
between
United
States
citizens
and
aliens
to
ensure
that
aliens
do
not
become
permanent
residents
through
sham
marriages.
Immigration
law
specifies
that
an
alien
seeking
permanent
residence
based
on
marriage
to
United
States
citizen
of
less
than
two
years
first
is
granted
conditional
permanent
resident
status.
After
two
years
the
husband
and
wife
must
apply
to
the
INS
to
remove
this
conditional
status.
Deportation
Deportation
is
the
expulsion
of
an
alien
who
entered
the
United
States
illegally
or
entered
legally
but
has
done
something
to
become
deportable.
With
few
exceptions
any
violation
of
the
conditions
of
visa
no
matter
how
minor
is
grounds
for
deportation
to
person
country
of
origin.
Conviction
for
any
crime
but
the
most
minor
is
also
grounds
for
deportation.
Deportation
can
delay
an
alien
whose
long-term
goal
is
to
live
permanently
in
this
country.
After
being
deported
aliens
are
forbidden
to
re-enter
the
country
for
five
years.
Aliens
deported
for
aggravated
felonies
such
as
drug
smuggling
are
barred
from
re-entry
for
years
or
may
be
barred
permanently.
The
delay
in
returning
to
the
United
States
may
be
even
greater
for
aliens
from
countries
with
long
waiting
lists.
Returning
home
under
deportation
order
may
result
in
the
embassy
refusal
to
entrust
the
individual
with
another
temporary
visa.
There
are
number
of
remedies
to
deportation
especially
if
the
deportable
person
has
lived
in
the
United
States
for
long
time
building
life
that
demonstrates
good
moral
character.
Even
if
the
deportable
individual
has
not
been
here
long
there
may
be
certain
waivers
or
defenses
to
deportation.
Among
the
most
common
is
asking
the
court
for
voluntary
departure
which
allows
the
individual
to
depart
the
United
States
on
his
or
her
own.
In
any
case
anyone
facing
deportation
should
seek
the
advice
of
counsel
well
in
advance
of
deportation
hearing.
