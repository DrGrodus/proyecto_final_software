This
chapter
outlines
how
the
criminal
justice
system
operates
and
describes
the
most
serious
criminal
violations--felonies
and
white
collar
crime.
It
also
includes
information
about
the
rights
of
persons
accused
of
crimes
and
the
rights
of
crime
victims.
Domestic
abuse
and
protective
orders
are
covered
in
the
Family
Law
Chapter.
Criminal
procedure
is
covered
in
the
Process
of
Case
Civil
Criminal
Chapter.
Private
causes
of
action
that
result
from
criminal
conduct
are
covered
in
the
Personal
Injury
Law
Chapters.
Finally
misdemeanors
the
juvenile
justice
system
and
driving-under-the-influence
violations
are
covered
in
the
Criminal
Law
DUI
Misdemeanors
Chapter.
Criminal
Codes
Criminal
law
defines
conduct
that
is
prohibited
by
the
government
and
the
range
of
penalties
that
can
be
imposed
for
violating
these
prohibitions.
Persons
who
violate
criminal
laws
incur
penalties
ranging
from
fines
to
imprisonment
or
in
some
states
execution.
All
crimes
are
defined
by
statutes.
These
statutes
are
collected
and
organized
into
books
of
rules
known
as
criminal
codes.
In
addition
to
the
Illinois
state
criminal
code
which
applies
only
in
Illinois
the
federal
government
has
criminal
code
that
regulates
certain
crimes
nationwide.
Most
criminal
activity
violates
either
state
law
or
federal
law
not
both
however
an
important
exception
is
drug
crimes
which
can
be
prosecuted
in
either
state
or
federal
court
or
both.
Every
crime
is
defined
by
list
of
elements.
In
criminal
trial
the
prosecutor
attempts
to
prove
all
the
elements
of
the
crime
the
person
is
accused
of
committing.
If
the
judge
or
the
jury
decides
all
the
elements
of
the
crime
have
been
proven
beyond
reasonable
doubt
the
accused
person
is
guilty
of
the
crime.
If
the
prosecutor
cannot
prove
all
the
elements
the
accused
cannot
be
found
guilty
of
the
crime.
Attempt
Conspiracy
Aiding
and
Abetting
Anyone
who
with
intent
to
commit
crime
takes
substantial
step
toward
committing
the
crime
may
be
guilty
of
attempt
to
commit
crime.
Merely
thinking
about
committing
crime
is
not
crime
even
preparation
for
crime
is
not
substantial
step.
For
example
if
someone
buys
gun
with
intent
to
kill
another
person
the
act
of
buying
is
mere
preparation.
However
going
to
person
house
after
buying
gun
with
intent
to
kill
the
person
may
be
substantial
step
that
is
enough
to
charge
person
with
attempting
to
commit
crime.
The
law
of
conspiracy
and
the
law
of
aiding
and
abetting
are
other
general
doctrines
that
apply
to
wide
range
of
offenses.
conspiracy
is
an
agreement
between
two
or
more
persons
to
commit
crime.
For
example
if
three
people
conspire
to
commit
murder
at
least
one
of
them
takes
action
to
further
the
conspiracy
and
the
murder
actually
occurs
they
all
can
be
charged
with
both
conspiracy
and
murder.
Even
if
conspirator
backs
out
of
the
conspiracy
but
the
other
conspirators
commit
the
crime
all
conspirators
may
be
criminally
liable
if
the
acts
were
reasonably
foreseeable.
person
who
intentionally
aids
or
advises
another
in
committing
crime
may
be
guilty
of
aiding
and
abetting
and
may
be
criminally
liable
for
the
acts
of
the
other
person
as
well.
Thus
if
someone
intentionally
advises
another
how
to
commit
robbery
and
lends
the
robber
car
to
use
in
the
getaway
both
people
are
equally
liable
under
the
law.
Offenses
Criminal
codes
penalize
variety
of
activities.
Generally
an
offense
is
any
violation
of
the
Illinois
Criminal
Code.
The
Criminal
Code
makes
major
distinction
between
felonies
and
misdemeanors.
felony
is
crime
for
which
person
can
be
sentenced
to
one
year
or
more
in
the
penitentiary
or
to
death.
Misdemeanors
are
crimes
for
which
person
can
be
sentenced
to
less
than
one
year
in
the
penitentiary.
Felonies
The
most
violent
crimes
such
as
murder
and
rape
as
well
as
so-called
white
collar
crimes
generally
are
felonies
under
the
Illinois
Criminal
Code.
Crimes
Causing
Harm
to
Persons
Homicide
and
Suicide
Homicide
is
the
unlawful
killing
of
another
human
being.
There
are
several
types
of
homicide
murder
manslaughter
and
reckless
homicide.
All
forms
of
homicide
are
felonies.
Murder
is
the
unlawful
killing
of
another
with
intent
to
kill.
Murder
is
divided
into
subcategories
by
degree
of
seriousness.
First
degree
murder
is
killing
someone
with
intent
to
kill
or
to
cause
great
bodily
harm
or
knowing
that
one
actions
will
cause
death
or
create
strong
probability
of
death
or
great
bodily
harm.
First
degree
murder
also
includes
unlawful
killing
during
the
commission
of
forcible
felony.
Second
degree
murder
is
similar
to
first
degree
murder
except
at
the
time
of
the
killing
the
offender
has
the
unreasonable
belief
that
the
killing
is
justified
or
the
offender
is
acting
under
an
intense
and
sudden
passion
resulting
from
being
provoked.
Manslaughter
and
reckless
homicide
differ
from
murder
because
these
crimes
do
not
require
proof
of
intent.
Under
Illinois
law
involuntary
manslaughter
is
unintentionally
killing
another
person
while
engaged
in
an
action
that
is
likely
to
cause
death
or
great
bodily
harm
if
the
action
is
done
recklessly.
However
if
the
cause
of
death
is
by
person
recklessly
driving
motor
vehicle
the
crime
is
called
reckless
homicide.
Suicide
is
taking
one
own
life.
Suicide
and
attempted
suicide
no
longer
are
crimes
in
Illinois.
However
it
is
crime
to
induce
another
to
commit
suicide.
Assault
and
Battery
Under
Illinois
law
assault
and
battery
are
separate
crimes.
Assault
is
defined
as
an
act
that

the
same
particular
circumstances

that
carries
with
it
severe
penalties.
Criminal
sexual
assault
is
sexual

All
forms
of
kidnapping
are
felonies.
Intimidation
The
crime
of
intimidation
is
defined
as
intending
to
cause
another
person
to
act
certain
way
by

person
commits
aggravated
stalking
by
actually
causing
physical
harm.
Another
form
of
aggravated
stalking
is
stalking
that
violates
an
order
of
protection.
Orders
of
protection
are
described
in
detail
in
the
Family
Law
Chapter.
Hate
Crime
Illinois
law
prohibits
hate
crime
which
is
defined
as
crime
such
as
assault
battery
or
theft
committed
against
person
because
of
his
or
her
ancestry
color
disability
gender
national
origin
race
or
sexual
orientation.
For
example
group
of
white
youths
who
chased
and
beat
two
black
youths
referring
to
them
using
racial
insults
were
guilty
of
hate
crime
in
Illinois.
Federal
Drug
and
Gun
Laws
Federal
laws
contain
harsh
penalties
for
distributing
controlled
substances
especially
if
firearms
are
even
remotely
involved.
For
example
any
person
who
possesses
with
intent
to
distribute
five
grams
of
crack
cocaine
is
subject
to
mandatory
sentence
of
five
years
without
parole.
If
gun
is
available
for
use
or
is
being
carried
during
drug
transaction--even
if
it
is
not
used--a
mandatory
five-year
sentence
must
be
imposed
consecutively
to
conviction
for
the
drug
offense.
Thus
the
person
with
five
grams
of
crack
cocaine
with
intent
to
distribute
would
receive
mandatory
ten-year
sentence
without
parole
if
he
or
she
was
carrying
gun.
In
most
circumstances
federal
judges
cannot
depart
from
these
mandatory
sentences.
Penalties
for
controlled
substance
offenses
become
even
harsher
as
quantities
of
the
contraband
increase.
Crimes
Causing
Harm
to
Property
Depending
on
the
value
of
the
property
involved
as
well
as
the
level
of
violence
most
property
crimes
are
felonies
in
Illinois.
The
legal
definition
of
theft
is
obtaining
exerting
control
over
and
intending
to
deprive
or
knowingly
using
concealing
or
abandoning
so
as
to
deprive
person
of
his
or
her
property.
This
definition
is
much
broader
than
what
most
people
think
of
as
theft.
It
can
include
writing
bad
checks
keeping
found
property
without
making
reasonable
attempt
to
find
its
rightful
owner
misusing
trade
secrets
unlawfully
tapping
into
cable
television
or
other
television
services
interfering
with
public
utilities
or
taking
large
sums
of
money
by
deception
from
persons
over
age
Unless
the
value
of
the
property
taken
is
or
less
the
crime
of
theft
is
felony.
Additionally
theft
always
is
felony
if
firearm
is
involved
or
if
the
accused
has
been
convicted
previously
of
theft
burglary
or
robbery.
Burglary
because
it
involves
entering
or
remaining
in
building
or
dwelling
without
authority
and
with
the
intent
to
commit
theft
or
felony
there
generally
is
felony.
Not
only
is
it
burglary
to
enter
house
unlawfully
with
the
intent
to
steal
money
or
property
but
it
also
is
burglary
to
enter
with
the
intent
to
commit
felony
such
as
arson
or
murder.
Similarly
robbery
almost
always
is
felonious.
Robbery
is
unlawfully
taking
personal
property
from
another
person
or
in
the
presence
of
the
other
person
while
using
or
threatening
to
use
force
against
the
person.
Aggravated
robbery
is
robbery
committed
with
dangerous
weapon.
White
Collar
Crimes
Although
there
is
no
fixed
definition
of
white
collar
crime
number
of
nonviolent
crimes
frequently
are
grouped
together
as
white
collar
crimes.
The
term
white
collar
crime
generally
is
used
to
describe
crimes
that
have
cheating
or
dishonesty
as
their
common
basis.
These
crimes
typically
are
committed
by
professionals
or
entrepreneurs
under
cover
of
legitimate
business
activity.
Such
crimes
may
be
difficult
to
prosecute
because
of
their
complexity.
Often
they
carry
lesser
penalties
because
they
are
not
associated
with
violence.
However
defendants
convicted
of
white
collar
crimes
may
incur
enormous
fines
be
ordered
to
pay
restitution
or
spend
time
in
jail.
Today
there
is
trend
toward
stricter
punishment
for
white
collar
crimes
as
people
recognize
the
financial
damage
white
collar
criminals
inflict
on
society.
As
practical
matter
it
is
impossible
to
describe
every
activity
that
fits
within
the
definition
of
white
collar
crime
because
white
collar
crime
takes
many
forms.
Some
criminal
actions
are
prohibited
by
specific
laws
narrowly
drawn
to
outlaw
particular
activity.
Other
actions
are
not
covered
by
specific
laws
but
instead
are
prosecuted
under
one
or
more
catch-all
laws
criminalizing
dishonest
behavior
generally.
Bribery
Federal
law
and
Illinois
law
both
prohibit
bribery.
The
purpose
of
most
bribery
statutes
is
to
prevent
people
from
seeking
preferential
treatment
from
public
officials
and
to
prevent
public
officers
from
using
their
offices
for
personal
gain.
Specifically
if
government
official
is
offered
or
seeks
anything
of
value
for
himself
or
herself
in
exchange
for
performing
an
official
act
fraudulous
action
or
any
action
in
violation
of
his
or
her
official
duty
the
elements
of
bribery
may
be
met.
Computer
Crime
Computer
crime
is
an
area
of
the
law
in
which
the
government
appears
to
be
playing
catch-up
with
the
growth
in
new
technologies.
Some
variations
of
computer
crime
are
so
new
that
there
are
no
specific
laws
to
address
them
and
general
laws
in
existence
do
not
seem
adequate
in
proscribing
the
particular
illicit
activities.
Generally
the
conduct
specifically
outlawed
by
federal
statute
includes
Knowingly
accessing
computer
without
authorization
or
exceeding
authorization
and
thereby
obtaining
confidential
national

Intentionally

if
such
computer
affects
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
or
is
used
by
or
for
the
government
Illinois
law
also
recognizes
the
crimes
of
computer
tampering
aggravated
computer
tampering
and
computer
fraud.
Computer

occurs
when

or

or
obtains

or

of
another
in
connection
with
scheme
to
defraud.
Computer
crimes
carry
severe
penalties
especially
as
the
value
of
the
property
damaged
or
stolen
increases.
Embezzlement
To
embezzle
means
to
take
another
money
or
property
through
abuse
of
an
official
job
or
position
of
trust.
Embezzlement
can
take
many
forms.
An
accountant
might
use
sophisticated
methods
to
falsify
records
and
skim
profits.
bank
teller
might
walk
home
with
an
extra
dollars
from
his
or
her
drawer.
Both
of
these
actions
constitute
embezzlement.
False
Statements
The
crime
of
making
false
statements
is
not
specific
to
white
collar
criminals
but
this
crime
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
activities
that
might
not
be
unlawful
if
not
for
associated
false
statements.
To
convict
someone
of
false
statements
requires
proof
of
statement
made
willfully
and
knowingly
that
contains
false
material
fact
or
conceals
material
fact.
Fraud
Fraud
is
intentionally
lying
in
order
to
induce
someone
into
relying
upon
the
lie
to
part
with
something
of
value.
Like
embezzlement
fraud
can
be
either
complex
or
simple.
The
federal
government
has
three
general
anti-fraud
statutes
for
mail
fraud
bank
fraud
and
wire
fraud.
Mail
fraud
has
two
elements
scheme
devised
or
intending
to
defraud
or
for
obtaining
property
or
money
by
fraudulent
means
and
using
the
mails
in
furtherance
of
that
fraudulent
scheme.
The
scheme
to
defraud
element
of
mail
fraud
is
deliberately
broad.
It
encompasses
wide
variety
of
criminal
activity
including
credit
card
fraud
securities
fraud
medical
drug
fraud
and
frauds
based
on
political
malfeasance.
Because
the
mail
fraud
statute
uses
such
broad
language
and
because
it
is
relatively
easy
to
prove
mail
fraud
is
one
of
the
most
common
charges
brought
by
federal
prosecutors.
Charges
of
mail
fraud
frequently
are
made
even
in
cases
in
which
more
specific
crimes
have
been
charged.
The
federal
wire
fraud
statute
is
similar
to
the
mail
fraud
statute
but
requires
an
interstate
or
foreign
transmittal
of
communication
by
wire
radio
or
television.
The
federal
bank
fraud
statute
criminalizes
the
conduct
of
any
party
who
knowingly
executes
or
attempts
to
execute
scheme
or
artifice
to
defraud
financial
institution
by
means
of
false
or
fraudulent
pretenses
representations
or
promises.
In
addition
Illinois
law
prohibits
fraud
generally
as
well
as
specific
fraudulent
acts.
In
Illinois
fraud
includes
such
crimes
as
public
aid
wire
fraud
and
deceptive
collections
practices.
The
crime
of
deceptive
practices
occurs
when
person
who
has
an
intent
to
defraud
uses
threat
or
deception
for
an
unlawful
purpose
such
as
to
Sign
document
transferring
property
or
creating
financial
obligation
Use
his
or
her
position
as
an
officer
or
manager
to
receive
an
investment
Issue
false
check
to
pay
taxes
buy
property
or
pay
for
services
Although
generally
the
crime
of
deceptive
practices
is
misdemeanor
if
the
property
at
issue
is
worth
or
several
transactions
within
-day
period
exceed
the
crime
becomes
felony.
Check
fraud
deception
of
financial
institutions
false
personation
forgery
and
possessing
another
identification
card
such
as
card
for
an
automated
teller
machine
also
are
crimes
under
Illinois
law.
Obstruction
of
Justice
Obstruction
of
justice
is
category
of
offenses
of
interference
in
one
of
the
three
branches
of
government.
Obstruction
of
justice
can
take
many
forms
including
assaulting
process
server
improperly
influencing
juror
stealing
or
altering
record
of
process
and
obstructing
criminal
investigation
by
officers
of
financial
institution.
Picketing
parading
or
using
sound
amplification
devices
in
front
of
courthouse
building
or
residence
occupied
by
judge
juror
witness
or
court
officer
may
be
prosecuted
as
obstruction
of
justice.
Perjury
Federal
perjury
laws
penalize
anyone
who
willfully
or
knowingly
makes
false
statements
under
oath.
The
sworn
statements
may
be
written
or
oral
and
need
not
be
made
in
court
person
may
perjure
himself
or
herself
in
deposition
or
written
testimony.
related
law
against
subornation
of
perjury
makes
it
illegal
for
anyone
to
procure
another
person
to
commit
perjury.
Racketeer
Influenced
and
Corrupt
Organizations
Act
The
Racketeer
Influenced
and
Corrupt
Organizations
Act
RICO
was
established
to
fight
the
influence
of
organized
crime
on
legitimate
businesses.
Under
federal
criminal
law
defendants
may
be
found
guilty
of
violating
RICO
if
they
engage
in
racketeering
activity
under
the
auspices
of
an
enterprise
that
affects
interstate
commerce
or
if
they
are
involved
in
the
collection
of
an
unlawful
debt.
There
are
state
and
federal
offenses
specifically
listed
as
racketeering
activity.
The
listed
state
offenses
are
murder
kidnapping
gambling
robbery
arson
bribery
dealing
in
obscene
materials
and
dealing
in
narcotics
or
other
dangerous
drugs.
While
drug
smuggling
murder
bribery
and
extortion
of
protection
money
are
examples
of
the
activities
to
which
RICO
originally
was
applied
more
recently
it
has
been
used
to
prosecute
an
increasing
variety
of
criminal
actions.
Securities
Fraud
and
Insider
Trading
broad
range
of
illegal
behavior
is
prosecuted
under
securities
fraud
statutes.
Criminal
prosecutions
require
the
prosecutor
to
show
that
the
accused
acted
willfully
if
the
accused
is
found
in
violation
he
or
she
is
subject
to
criminal
penalties
civil
penalties
or
both.
The
securities
fraud
statutes
recognize
that
deception
may
take
many
forms
and
thus
are
worded
broadly
to
prohibit
any
device
scheme
or
artifice
to
defraud
in
securities
sales.
There
are
two
general
categories
of
securities
fraud.
The
first
involves
the
sale
of
securities
to
investors
for
far
more
than
their
actual
value.
The
second
involves
the
sale
of
legitimate
securities
for
illegal
purposes.
An
example
of
the
first
type
of
fraud
is
selling
shares
in
dry
oil
wells.
An
example
of
the
second
type
of
fraud
is
sale
of
legitimate
stock
by
broker
who
conceals
information
about
his
or
her
own
involvement
with
the
brokerage
company.
These
acts
are
prohibited
by
rules
established
by
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission.
Insider
trading
prosecutions
have
been
some
of
the
most
publicized
white
collar
prosecutions
of
the
and
s.
Surprisingly
insider
trading
is
not
defined
in
any
specific
statute
it
is
term
used
to
describe
insiders
such
as
officers
of
corporation
taking
unfair
advantage
of
information
to
make
money
or
avoid
losing
money
in
securities.
Generally
insider
trading
means
that
an
insider
with
material
non-public
information
engages
in
trading
without
disclosing
that
information
to
the
public
first.
These
crimes
typically
are
prosecuted
under
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Act
of
However
prosecutors
are
not
confined
to
using
specific
securities
fraud
statutes
to
prosecute
securities
fraud.
General
anti-fraud
statutes
may
be
used
instead
of
or
in
addition
to
specific
securities
fraud
laws.
For
example
parties
engaged
in
securities
fraud
may
be
charged
with
violating
mail
and
wire
fraud
statutes.
Tax
Crimes
Often
people
charged
with
other
white
collar
crimes
are
accused
of
committing
tax
crime
also.
Failing
to
file
tax
return
or
filing
false
tax
return
is
crime
as
is
interfering
with
the
administration
of
the
internal
revenue
laws.
Specific
laws
prohibit
obstruction
extortion
or
bribery
with
regard
to
tax
official.
Defenses
and
Punishment
In
some
criminal
trials
the
prosecutor
proves
all
the
elements
of
crime
but
the
person
accused
is
not
punished
because
he
or
she
has
valid
defense.
Self-defense
sometimes
is
used
as
defense.
The
general
rule
for
self-defense
is
that
person
may
use
any
amount
of
force--except
deadly
force--that
he
or
she
reasonably
believes
is
necessary
to
prevent
immediate
unlawful
harm
to
person.
Using
deadly
force
is
permissible
only
when
it
reasonably
appears
to
be
necessary
to
avoid
immediate
death
or
serious
injury
to
person
or
to
prevent
the
commission
of
felony
in
the
actor
dwelling.
If
person
claims
that
he
or
she
acted
in
self-defense
the
prosecutor
must
prove
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
self-defense
was
not
the
reason
for
the
crime.
By
itself
intoxication
is
not
defense
to
crime.
In
rare
cases
intoxication
works
like
defense
if
there
is
proof
that
the
person
accused
of
the
crime
was
unable
to
form
the
necessary
intent
to
commit
crime.
Someone
who
is
intoxicated
may
not
be
found
guilty
of
crime
that
requires
he
or
she
acted
intentionally
but
the
intoxicated
person
may
be
guilty
of
another
crime
that
does
not
require
intentional
actions.
In
the
area
of
white
collar
crime
the
same
defenses
are
available
to
defendants
as
those
available
in
crimes
generally.
Some
people
accused
of
white
collar
crimes
also
claim
entrapment
by
the
government
they
argue
they
were
induced
to
act
and
would
not
have
acted
unlawfully
otherwise.
Another
common
defense
by
businesses
is
that
particular
businessperson
was
acting
alone
without
the
authority
of
the
company
behind
him
or
her.
Businesses
further
argue
that
once
it
was
discovered
that
an
officer
or
employee
was
acting
unlawfully
the
business
acted
immediately
to
resolve
the
situation.
Sometimes
business
avoids
criminal
liability
altogether
if
it
shows
that
it
took
proper
action
to
correct
situation
as
soon
as
managers
were
made
aware
of
problem.
Felonies
and
white
collar
crimes
carry
the
strictest
punishments
such
as
lengthy
imprisonment
heavy
fines
or
even
death.
Federal
sentencing
guidelines
contain
method
for
calculating
fines
to
be
paid
by
organizations
that
commit
crimes.
Businesses
that
are
found
guilty
of
operating
for
primarily
criminal
purpose
incur
fines
equal
to
their
total
assets.
Illinois
also
has
laws
that
allow
the
authorities
to
seize
property
connected
with
the
commission
of
crime.
For
example
any
money
or
other
profits
connected
with
computer
fraud
may
be
seized
by
the
government.
Similarly
person
charged
with
violating
laws
connected
with
controlled
substances
must
forfeit
the
substances
as
well
as
the
raw
materials
used
to
make
the
drugs
vehicles
and
real
property
used
to
further
the
crime
and
any
money
or
other
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
the
controlled
substances.
Crime
Victims
Rights
Victims
of
the
most
violent
crimes
have
rights
in
the
Illinois
criminal
justice
system.
Under
the
Bill
of
Rights
for
Victims
and
Witnesses
of
Violent
Crime
Act
victim
of
violent
crime
generally
has
the
right
to
be
notified
of
the
status
of
the
investigation
whether
an
indictment
has
been
brought
the
time
and
place
of
any
hearings
and
when
the
defendant
is
released
from
custody.
The
Illinois
Victims
Rights
Constitutional
Amendment
also
gives
all
victims
the
right
to
be
treated
with
fairness
the
right
to
privacy
the
right
to
make
statement
at
sentencing
and
the
right
to
reasonable
protection
from
the
accused
during
the
criminal
justice
proceedings.
Some
crime
victims
also
have
right
to
compensation
for
the
crimes
committed
against
them.
This
means
that
crime
victim
may
receive
compensation
for
certain
expenses
or
losses
such
as
medical
expenses
or
loss
of
support
if
the
crime
victims
becomes
unable
to
support
dependents.
There
are
requirements
that
must
be
met
for
victim
to
get
reimbursement
and
victim
must
file
an
application
for
consideration
with
the
Illinois
Court
of
Claims
for
compensation.
The
maximum
amount
victim
can
receive
from
the
Court
of
Claims
is
Under
some
Illinois
laws
the
victim
may
receive
compensation
from
the
person
who
committed
the
crime.
This
is
called
restitution.
For
example
person
whose
vehicle
is
stolen
may
be
able
to
receive
compensation
for
the
vehicle.
In
this
case
the
state
arranges
to
collect
the
money
from
the
criminal
and
sends
check
to
the
victim
when
all
the
restitution
has
been
made.
If
the
court
does
not
order
restitution
or
if
prosecutor
does
not
press
charges
the
victim
still
has
the
option
to
seek
compensation
directly
by
suing
the
offender
in
civil
court.
This
option
is
discussed
more
fully
in
the
Process
of
Case
Civil
Criminal
Chapter.
