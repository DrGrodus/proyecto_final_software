PT
Digital
watermarking
is
popular
new
way
to
protect
copyrighted
images.
Here
how
it
works
Step
Watermarkcreated
The
image
creator
stamps
the
image
with
digital
watermark
that
can
only
be
viewed
with
special
software.
The
watermark
takes
advantage
of
the
variation
between
pixels
to
remain
all
but
invisible
in
the
finished
product.
The
watermark
can
still
be
detected
with
the
special
software
even
after
the
image
is
printed
and
rescanned.
Step
Watermark
detected
Image
editors
such
as
Photoshop
are
equipped
with
the
special
software.
The
application
can
detect
the
subtle
pixel
variation
and
interprets
it
as
watermark
alerting
the
viewer
that
the
image
has
been
copyrighted.
Step
Artist
identified
In
addition
to
marking
the
image
as
copyrighted
work
the
watermark
contains
information
on
how
to
contact
the
artist.
